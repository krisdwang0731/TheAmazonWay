# 3. Invent and Simplify

> Leaders at Amazon expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify the processes they touch. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here" thinking. And they are willing to innovate fearlessly, despite the fact that they may be misunderstood for a long time.

Amazon.com currently sells more goods online than its next twelve biggest competitors combined, including Staples and Walmart.<sup>1</sup> What's more, Amazon.com's sales are growing faster than Internet sales as a whole. When I am asked to explain this unprecedented growth, I go immediately to one of Jeff Bezoz's key leadership principles: Amazon.com continues to grow by inventing and simplifying every single day.

Jeff understand the same thing that Steve Jobs did: the best desgin is the simplest. Simple is the key to easy, fast, intuitive, and low cost. Simple scales much better than complex, which means that simplicity is intrinsically linked to another leadership principle: Think Big (chapter 7). As a leader at Amazon.com, you are not expected to design and build a new innovation with ten to one hundred people in mind. You must design it for millions of customers and tens of thousands of ecosystem partners, such as merchants and developers - "innovation at scale" - which means truly understanding the users and innovating with them in mind.

I recently saw an Amazon press release stating that it had eight thousand Amazon Web Services (AWS) partners - companies that are building solutions and going to market in the could computing business segment. With that kind of partnership base, Amazon.com leaders are driven to focus on innovation at scale, achieving repeatable and sustainable organic growth through new products, services, and business models that build on the core business. It's a clearly defined, durable, and oft-repeated directive that is woven into the organizational DNA from the C-suite to the warehouse.

At Amazon, your job description is never limited to simply running things. No matter what your job, you are exptected to improve on the processes in ways that ultimately enhance the customer experience and lower costs. Amazon.com engineers, for example, do not consider themselves coders but rather problem solvers. This mentality promotes big thinking - game - changing solutions and inventions - rather than finger-in-the-dike fixes.



## Simplification Epitomized: Amazon's Platform Businesses

In the world of business, the term *platform* has come to refer to a state in which machines interact seamlessly to knit together complex processes and tasks performed by various parties. Amazon.com is a platform. It could have stopped at selling books - the "books platform" - but instead it has cascaded its scope of service to all forms of consumer items and even to enterprise itself. 

My time at Amazon.com make me a big believer in the power of process automation to make workflows impler and more productive. When a process is automated, it's not only easier to scale but also simpler to measure, while manual effort, even when it begins at a seemingly insignificant level, can evolve into an expensive, nonsalable, and non-real-time capability. That is why automation, algorithms, and technology architecture are engines behind game-changing platform business such as Kindle, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Third-Party Sellers, Fulfillment by Amazon, and Amazon Web Services.

The second page of Jeff's 2011 shareholder letter, entitled "The Power of Invention, " is a manifesto about the undeniable import of data science and computer science on the growth of Amazon's platform businesses:

​		Invention comes in many forms and at many scales. The most radical and transformative of inventions are often those that empower others to 		  		unleash their creativity - to pursue their dreams. That's a big part of what's going on with Amazon Web Services, Fulfillment by Amazon, and Kindle   		Direct Publishing. With AWS, FBA, and KDP, we are creating powerful self-service platforms that allow thousands of people to boldly experiment and   		accomplish things that would otherwise be impossible or impractical. These innvative, large-scale platforms are not zero-sum - they create win-win   		situations and create significant value for developers, entrepreneurs, customers, authors, and readers.

Amazon Web Services has grown to have thirty different services and thousands of large and small businesses and individual developers as customers. One of the first AWS offerings, the Simple Storage Service, or S3, now holds over nine hundred billion data objects, with more than a billion new objects being added every day. S3 routinely handles more than half a million transactions per second and has peaked at close to a million transactions per second. All AWS services are pay-as-you-go and radically transform capital expense into a variable cost. AWS is self-service: you don't need to negotiate a contract or engage with a salesperson - you can just read the online documentation and get started. AWS services are elastic - they easily scale up and easily scale down.

In just the last quarter of 2011, Fulfillment by Amazon shipped tens of millions of items on behalf of sellers. When sellers use FBA, their items become eligible for Amazon Prime, for Super Saver Shipping, and for Amazon returns processing and customer service. FBA is self-service and comes with an easy-to-use inventory management console as part of Amazon Seller Central. For the more technically inclined, it also come with a set of APIs [application programing interfaces] so that you can use our global fulfillment center network like a giant computer peripheral.

​		I am emphasizing the self-service nature of these platforms because it's important for a reason I think it somewhat non-obvious: even well-meaning   		gatekeepers slow innovation. When a platform is self-service, even the improbable ideas can get tried, because there's not expert gatekeeper ready   		to say, "that will never work!" And guess what - many of those improbable ideas do work, and society is the beneficiary of that diversity.<sup>2</sup>

Amazon.com's business platform are enablers. They enable writes and booksellers. They enable businesses looking to outsource labor. They enable people and companies that want to use Amazon's technology and computing capacity. Then enable smaller organizations to enhance their reputations by piggbacking on that of Amazon. By empowering entrepreneurs, they enable personal and professional growth for thousands of individuals. Amazon.com's business platforms build virtuous cycles that circulate and expand energy in much the same way as the Amazon flywheel itself.

So if you want to understand how Amazon.com thinks about the principle of invent and simplify, you need to understand the platform opportunity.

As I've noted, technology makes the platform possible. But algorithm， automation, workflow, and technology are only part of how Amazon is inventing and simplifying. More important is the fact capabilities are designed *from the user backwards*. When we were building the third-party selling business at Amazon.com, creating a great experience for the seller was our goal. Building a simple seller registration process was difficult but eseential to achieving that goal, and my job was to push engineering teams to integrate more than forty different underlying systems to create a seamless and simple workflow for that process.

Willingness to rethink policies, rules, and other assumptions that are widely accepted in the business world is critical. So is asking and answering the questions, "If I had to completely automate the process and eliminate all manual steps, how would I design it?" Instead of aiming for a 10 percent reduction in friction, push a much more radical rethinking of assumptions; ask "the five whys" (see chapter 12, "Deep Dive"), and have the willingness to challenge the status quo. This is where all types of resistance, both active and passive, will be experienced, requiring a response from strong execuitive leadership. Some jobs will be changed; others will be eliminated. For all these reasons, it takes vision, creativity, desire, and courage to carry out the invent-and-simplify principle.



## Process vs. Bureaucracy

Notice that two halves of the principle - invent and simplify - are both equally necessary. Process innovation can be enormously powerful, but when it is practticed without an emphasis on simplicity, the result is bureaucracy - the multiplication of processes for their won sake.

One of the great observations I heard from Jeff came during one of our all-hands meetings, held at a local movie theater. Jeff took a question from an employee about avoiding bureaucracy while still ensuring that certain rules were put in place. Jeff responded with, "Good process is absolutely essential. Without defined processes, you can't scale, you can't put metrics and instrumentation in place, you can't manage. But avoiding bureaucracy is essential. Bureaucracy is process run amok."

Jeff understood that A-level performers hate bureaucracy and will leave organizations where is encroaches upon them. By contrast, C- and D-Level performers, many of whom typically reside in middle management in any give organization, love bureaucracy because they can hide behind it, acting as gatekeepers and frequently creating the kind of friction that can dog down an entire company. Strong processes with measurable outcomes dliminate bureaucracy and expose underperformers.

So how do you recognize bureaucracy and distinguish it from well-defined process? When the rules can't be explained; when they don't favor the customer; when you can't get redress from a higher authority; when you can't get an answer to reasonable question; when there is no service level agreement or guaranteed response time built into the process; or when the rules simply don't make sense - when any of these circumstances occur, the chances are good that bureaucracy is beginning to spread.

I distinctly remember one particular S-Team meeting where Jeff looked east, our across Lake Washington to the Microsoft campus, and told us, "I don't want this place to become a country club." He truly feared that, with success and growth, Amazon would become complacent and bloated like MicroSoft; that we would cease to insist on the highest standards and gradually entangle ourselves in a giant ball of red tape. He told us that is we become like Microsoft, we would die. What's worse, he said, it won't be fun to come to work anymore.

As you work to invent and perfect processes, always remember that simplify is an essential bulwark against the creeping onslaught of bureaucracy.



## Other People's Work and the Mechanical Turk

Even Amazon.com can't automate everything. One of my favorite strategies for dealing with this fact is the mobilizing of Other People's Work (OPW). In many cases, the best way to scale an unavoidable residue of manual labor is to enable and motivate othere people to do it.

Consider just two of the many tasks that must be done when building an e-commerce website with a virtually infinite array of products: evaluating the quiality of a product image and writing clear and accurate product descriptions. Neither can be handled effectively by a computer. Instead of hiring a vast army of people to perform these small but essential and practically endless tasks, Amazon.com handed that task over to its customers and partners. It created a product image management tool that collected customer feedback, allowed customers to compare images, and enabled them to report offensive or irrelevent content. It worked extremely well. Before long, Amazon.com was using OPW to manage other processes that couldn't be automated. Customer reveiws, which were controversial when Amazon frist introduced them, are greate example of OPW - a way of allowing thousands of Amazon customers to handle the task of describing, rating, and categorizing products for the benefits of millions of other users of website.

With eh right approach, almost every company can find opportunities for OPW. Many of my current clients are finding that letting vendors, customers, or business partners carry out activities for which they have greater motivation and better expertise can be a powerful step toward transforming their businesses while dramtically cutting costs.

Eventually, Amaozn's basic OPW concept was retooled into a platform for others to use named Amazon Mechanical Turk. It's an online marketplace that provides businesses access to an on-demand, scalable, flexible army of freelancers they can hire to tackle small, manal tasks. Countless companies use this platform daily to levergate a worldwide employment base and, of course, Amazon.com makes money every time they do.



## Third-Party Sellers: Inventing a Platform and Making it Simple

One of the best examples of the principle of invent and simplify is the project that brought me to Amazon in the fisrt place - the development of the third-party seller program.

In late 2001, I was working at a technology start-up and actively looking for the next big thing - both in my own career and in the world of business in general. Jason Kilar (who later became the founder and CEO of Hulu). They invited me to interview at Amazon.com. The successful candidate, I was told, would lead a business responsible for designing and operating a capability that would allow third parites to sell at Amazon.com.

Over the next two months, I had twenty-three interviews at Amazon.com. It was, without a doubt, the most exhaustive, intense hiring process I have experienced. What we were really doing in these interviews was refining strategy and brainstorming the requirements of a third-party selling business. A precursor already existed. Unfortunately, zShops was largely defined by its horrible customer experience and shoddy inventory. I remember thinking, "Well, the idea is there, but I'm hearing some fairly unbacked plans and expectations."

Eventually, I was hired to lead the launch of the third-party business as Amazon.com's first director of merchant integration. I had direct accountability managing all the mechants (a.k.a sellers) that we were going to bring on board for the opening of the apparel cateogry in late 2002, including brands like Nordstrom, Gap, Eddie Bauer, and Macys. But I was also responsible for making the Amazon.com third-party seller experience just as enjoyable and frictionless as the customer experience. We realized that without a seller-experience culture, the new business would not succeed, and we adopted "seller success" as our mission.

At the time, the dominant third-party selling marketplace was eBay. Their mentality was very laissez-faire; they simply connected buyers with sellers, taking little accoutability for customer experience or trust between merchants and shoppers. If you searched for a specific model of camera, you might get pages and pages of individual listings that offered no help in understanding how the items or the offers to sell compared. (Incidentally, eBay has since significantly changed and improved in many of these areas, primarily due to the pressure arising from the success of Amazon.com.)

By contrast, we defined three main design principles that were important to us in building our third-party marketplace business:

1. Present the customer with a single item accompanied by an easy-to-compare list of offers to sell that item. We called this  design principle "item authority." Create a single definition of the item, which would allow multiple sellers, including Amazon, to make offers to sell the item. We wanted to create a marketplace where sellers would be competing for the order in a way that worked to the customer's benefit.
2. Make it possible for customers to trust our third-party sellers as much as they trusted Amazon.com itself. We operationalized the concept of "seller trust" in serval ways.
3. Provide greatet seller tools, including multiple selling methods and rich data, to help merchants operate their businesses at Amazon.com. For small sellers, simple tools were needed. For more sophisticated high-volume sellers, different types of integrated capabilities should be provided. Documentation, operational metrics, testing environments, and professional service partners should be developed to help sellers be successful while keeping the Amazon team small.

Obviously this was an ambitious program that required a highly complex integration between sellers and Amazon.com. It was clear to me that Amazon.com simply didn't have the human resources to manually govern a platform like this at scale. We had to make the third-party marketplace self-service. We had to provide a simple-to-use, highly intuitive tool for sellers, as well as a system what would somehow cullsubpar sellers from the marketplace in order to keep customer trust high.

We quickly realized that the only way to accomplish all this way by taking a page from the OPW book. Fortunately, Jeff Bezoz smiles upon projects designed to scale a business on a self-service platform. One of Jeff's favorite techniques is to create a *forcing function* - a set of guidelines, restrictions, or commitments that force a desirable outcome without having to manage all the details of making it happen. Forcing functions are a powerful techniques used at Amazon.com to enforce a strategy or change.

One exmaple of a forcing function was the concept of direct versus indirect head count. Direct head count for a particular project would typically includde system development engineers (SDEs), technical program managers, and people who negotiated contracts, such as vendor managers. In Jeff's mind, these were the essential skills to build a scalable company. All other head count - all the people that don't directly create a better customer experience - was considered indirect. The forcing function was that acquiring direct head count was relatively easy to get approved. However, indirect head count was constrainded and had to justified by demonstrating that it would decrease with scale in the business.

In building the third-party business, my indirect head count consisted of the account managers I hired to help assist merchants complete their integration into Aamazon.com. These acount managers initially launched fifteen to twenty merchants at a time, but before long they were launching fifty to one hundred merchants. Eventually, the number became astronomical. The forcing function did exactly what is was intended to do - it enabled us to build capabilities and processes that scaled well and became more efficient over time.

Under Clifford Cancelosi's drection, our team built tools, metrics, dashboards, alarms, and other capabilities to help the sellers meet all of their contractual commitments to us and to help them live up to our marketplace's high standards, and, ultimately, the expectations of their customers. We also built various technological and operational tools for monitoring their performance. For example, we policed the price and availibility of an item on the seller's website to esure it was not less expensive or easier to purchase than it was at the Amazon.com marketplace, and we flagged sellers who made unreasonable commitments or failed to keep their promises.

Eventually we built a seller's trust index based on all the touch points between merchant and customer, as well as all the promises a merchant made. Every seller could track the answers to questions like, Is my content good? Am I fulfilling orders on time? Am I managing returns correctly? Is my customer feedback good? All of this was then rolled into an aggregated index yielding a score for each seller. We used many functions and algorithms to reward high-performing sellers - for exmaple, by having them vault to the top of search results. In this way, the third-party marketpalce evolved into a highly efficient, self-governing meritocracy. If a seller's score was really low, our management team would have various discussions with him or her before eventually removing the seller from the platform.

Equally important was Item Authority. Deceptively simple at first blush, Itema Authority was perhaps the merchant program's quintessential invent-and-simplify innovation and a major reason for our success. In order to increase item selection, availability, and price competition, we signed up multiple sellers of the same item. Item Authority reconciled onto one page all of the various content from sellers selling the same item. It forced sellers to compete on price, selection, and convenience, while markedly improving the customer experience. Instead of having to look through pages and pages for the best deal on a single item - which is essentially how eBay worked at the time - customers were presented with the most competitive offers in one place.

Taken together, all these innovations worked remarkably well. Today, there are over two-million third-party sellers at Amazon.com, accouting for 40 percent of all Amzon units shipped and critical nature of Item Authority (the language comes from a job description):

​		Item Authority is a mission-critical service at the heart of Amazon's business, and we are looking for a passionate, results-oriented, intentive   			   		software manager to head it up.

​		When a merchant submits a product for listing in Amazon's catalog, Item Authority searches the catalog for matches. It either approves assigning   		that offer to a page, authorizes creation of a new page, or rejects the submission with an error. And it does this tens of millions of times per day.

​		This "Matching" technology enables the creation of high quality Single Detail Pages (SDP) that help Amazon provide a great experience for our   		  		customers. It relies heavily on search technology (using A9), auto-classification, custom rules, and machine learning techniques for success. The ideal   		candidate thrives a fast-paced environment, understand elements of matching, search, and machine learning, and will help us build features that   		reduce merchant friction and drive revenue for Amazon.<sup>3</sup>

Described this way, it all sounds rather matter-of-fact, even obvious. But now that you know the story behind the story, you can see that inventing Item Authority and the other elements of Amazon's third-party seller program - and the simplifying them for the benefit of every user of the platform - was far from easy.
