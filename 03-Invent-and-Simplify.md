# 3. Invent and Simplify

> Leaders at Amazon expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify the processes they touch. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here" thinking. And they are willing to innovate fearlessly, despite the fact that they may be misunderstood for a long time.

Amazon.com currently sells more goods online than its next twelve biggest competitors combined, including Staples and Walmart.<sup>1</sup> What's more, Amazon.com's sales are growing faster than Internet sales as a whole. When I am asked to explain this unprecedented growth, I go immediately to one of Jeff Bezoz's key leadership principles: Amazon.com continues to grow by inventing and simplifying every single day.

Jeff understand the same thing that Steve Jobs did: the best desgin is the simplest. Simple is the key to easy, fast, intuitive, and low cost. Simple scales much better than complex, which means that simplicity is intrinsically linked to another leadership principle: Think Big (chapter 7). As a leader at Amazon.com, you are not expected to design and build a new innovation with ten to one hundred people in mind. You must design it for millions of customers and tens of thousands of ecosystem partners, such as merchants and developers - "innovation at scale" - which means truly understanding the users and innovating with them in mind.

I recently saw an Amazon press release stating that it had eight thousand Amazon Web Services (AWS) partners - companies that are building solutions and going to market in the could computing business segment. With that kind of partnership base, Amazon.com leaders are driven to focus on innovation at scale, achieving repeatable and sustainable organic growth through new products, services, and business models that build on the core business. It's a clearly defined, durable, and oft-repeated directive that is woven into the organizational DNA from the C-suite to the warehouse.

At Amazon, your job description is never limited to simply running things. No matter what your job, you are exptected to improve on the processes in ways that ultimately enhance the customer experience and lower costs. Amazon.com engineers, for example, do not consider themselves coders but rather problem solvers. This mentality promotes big thinking - game - changing solutions and inventions - rather than finger-in-the-dike fixes.



## Simplification Epitomized: Amazon's Platform Businesses

In the world of business, the term *platform* has come to refer to a state in which machines interact seamlessly to knit together complex processes and tasks performed by various parties. Amazon.com is a platform. It could have stopped at selling books - the "books platform" - but instead it has cascaded its scope of service to all forms of consumer items and even to enterprise itself. 

My time at Amazon.com make me a big believer in the power of process automation to make workflows impler and more productive. When a process is automated, it's not only easier to scale but also simpler to measure, while manual effort, even when it begins at a seemingly insignificant level, can evolve into an expensive, nonsalable, and non-real-time capability. That is why automation, algorithms, and technology architecture are engines behind game-changing platform business such as Kindle, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Third-Party Sellers, Fulfillment by Amazon, and Amazon Web Services.

The second page of Jeff's 2011 shareholder letter, entitled "The Power of Invention, " is a manifesto about the undeniable import of data science and computer science on the growth of Amazon's platform businesses:

​		Invention comes in many forms and at many scales. The most radical and transformative of inventions are often those that empower others to 		  		unleash their creativity - to pursue their dreams. That's a big part of what's going on with Amazon Web Services, Fulfillment by Amazon, and Kindle   		Direct Publishing. With AWS, FBA, and KDP, we are creating powerful self-service platforms that allow thousands of people to boldly experiment and   		accomplish things that would otherwise be impossible or impractical. These innvative, large-scale platforms are not zero-sum - they create win-win   		situations and create significant value for developers, entrepreneurs, customers, authors, and readers.

Amazon Web Services has grown to have thirty different services and thousands of large and small businesses and individual developers as customers. One of the first AWS offerings, the Simple Storage Service, or S3, now holds over nine hundred billion data objects, with more than a billion new objects being added every day. S3 routinely handles more than half a million transactions per second and has peaked at close to a million transactions per second. All AWS services are pay-as-you-go and radically transform capital expense into a variable cost. AWS is self-service: you don't need to negotiate a contract or engage with a salesperson - you can just read the online documentation and get started. AWS services are elastic - they easily scale up and easily scale down.

In just the last quarter of 2011, Fulfillment by Amazon shipped tens of millions of items on behalf of sellers. When sellers use FBA, their items become eligible for Amazon Prime, for Super Saver Shipping, and for Amazon returns processing and customer service. FBA is self-service and comes with an easy-to-use inventory management console as part of Amazon Seller Central. For the more technically inclined, it also come with a set of APIs [application programing interfaces] so that you can use our global fulfillment center network like a giant computer peripheral.

​		I am emphasizing the self-service nature of these platforms because it's important for a reason I think it somewhat non-obvious: even well-meaning   		gatekeepers slow innovation. When a platform is self-service, even the improbable ideas can get tried, because there's not expert gatekeeper ready   		to say, "that will never work!" And guess what - many of those improbable ideas do work, and society is the beneficiary of that diversity.<sup>2</sup>

Amazon.com's business platform are enablers. They enable writes and booksellers. They enable businesses looking to outsource labor. They enable people and companies that want to use Amazon's technology and computing capacity. Then enable smaller organizations to enhance their reputations by piggbacking on that of Amazon. By empowering entrepreneurs, they enable personal and professional growth for thousands of individuals. Amazon.com's business platforms build virtuous cycles that circulate and expand energy in much the same way as the Amazon flywheel itself.

So if you want to understand how Amazon.com thinks about the principle of invent and simplify, you need to understand the platform opportunity.

As I've noted, technology makes the platform possible. But algorithm， automation, workflow, and technology are only part of how Amazon is inventing and simplifying. More important is the fact capabilities are designed *from the user backwards*. When we were building the third-party selling business at Amazon.com, creating a great experience for the seller was our goal. Building a simple seller registration process was difficult but eseential to achieving that goal, and my job was to push engineering teams to integrate more than forty different underlying systems to create a seamless and simple workflow for that process.

Willingness to rethink policies, rules, and other assumptions that are widely accepted in the business world is critical. So is asking and answering the questions, "If I had to completely automate the process and eliminate all manual steps, how would I design it?" Instead of aiming for a 10 percent reduction in friction, push a much more radical rethinking of assumptions; ask "the five whys" (see chapter 12, "Deep Dive"), and have the willingness to challenge the status quo. This is where all types of resistance, both active and passive, will be experienced, requiring a response from strong execuitive leadership. Some jobs will be changed; others will be eliminated. For all these reasons, it takes vision, creativity, desire, and courage to carry out the invent-and-simplify principle.
