# Introduction

It is January, 2003. With less than a year under my belt as Amazon.com's director of merchant integration, I am stil considered the new guy on the block. At the moment, I am sitting in a conference room in the company's Seattle headquarters, surrounded by what's called the S-Team, a group that includes Amazon's twenty most senior executives, and I happen to be the center of attention. Unfortunately, this is because the founder and CEO, Jeff Bezoz, is frustrated.

"The answer to that question begins with a number!" he roars.

All eyes had turned in my direction when Jeff asked me a deceptive simple question: "How many merchants have launched since the first of the year?"

The question puzzled me, since at the moment there simply aren't any third-party sellers - "merchants," in Jeff's parlance - to launch, which was out of my direct control. A bit apologetically, I responded, "Well, you see, as of right now - "

Because I could finish, Jeff erupted, "The answer to that question begin with a number!"

Jeff's reputation for pyrotechnic displays of emotion is already part of this legend. Jeff Bezoz doesn't  worry about your feelings; he doesn't give a damn whether or nor you're having a good day. He only cares about results - and they'd better be the right results. Everyone who joins Amazon.com understands this; it's part of the deal. But this is the first time I've found myself at the business end of his double-barreled fury, and I'm more than a little shell-shocked by the experience. I hesitate, frantically juggling possible responses in my head. Finally, taking a big gulp, I offer the simple answer the is asking for: "Six, but..."

Jeff pounces like a lion tearing into the soft underbelly of its kill. "That is the most pathetic answer I have ever heard!"

The ensuing rant is neither a simple exercise in humiliation nor some soft of power play designed to reinforce Jeff's status as the alpha dog of Amazon.com. It's an educational exercise that uses my situation as an opportunity to set an example and to transmit a seies of clutural, strategic, and operational messages to the leaders of the company. The lecture is classic Jeff because, despite its thunderous volume and tone, it contans valuable lessons about the principles that define Amazon.com. In the next five minutes, Jeff touches on a half dozen of there principles as the describes my short-comings in painful detail. I am chastised for my failure to sufficiently obsess over the customer, for not taking complete ownership of my project and its outcomes, for not setting higher standards for myself and my team, for not thinking bing enough, for not possessing a bias for action, and for not being firmly and vocally selft-critical when it was clear my performance was lacking. Throughout, I am pinned to my chair as if by a hurricane-force gale.

When Jeff's rant finally ends, he simply leaves the room without another word and, just like that, the S-Team meeting has ended. As I allow myselft to start breathing again, processing what has just happened, I notice that many of the other senior leaders are smiling at me - and not unkindly. A few make a point of congratulating me as they gather their things and file out of he conference room.

"He like you," one explains with a pat on the shoulder. "He wouldn't take the time to embarrass you like that if he didn't." 

In a fog, i stumble from the conference room, clutching my notes and half-wondering how it is that I am still employed. "How can anyone possibly withstand the white-hot crucible of Jeff's expectations?" I wonder.

The answer, of course, is right in front ot my nose. In fact, it's publicly available on the Amazon.com site if you know where to look<sup>1</sup>. And in that 2003 meeting, Jeff was all but hitting me over the head with it: the fourteen leadership principles that drive Amazon, from top to bottom. I've edited a bit of the language of the leadership principals for readability.

How has Jeff Bezoz build a company, a culture, and a legacy that meet his highest standards? Unlike in most organizations, Amazon's leadership principles are not simply suggested guidelines for new hirer or empty verbiage from a mission statement buried in the employee manual. They are core tenets on which company leaders are rigorously read during their annual performance reviews and self-evaluations. In fact, as a leader or potential leader at Amazon.com, you are expected to record concrete examples of how you embody the fourteen leadership principles, and be prepared to cite them upon request.

This book is not a tell-all story of my time at Amazon.com. The fact is that, after I moved on to my current position as a managing director at the consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal, I didn't expect to think much about my years at Amazon.com. Funny things, though: as I began to tackle the wide range of challenges presented by my clients in fields from technology and manufacturing to retail and even philanthropy, I found myself frequently referencing strategies, management techniques, and approaches I had experienced at Amazon.com. At first, I didn't even notice. I was doing it. Then a colleague of mine said, "You know, you sould really write those down."

"Write what down?" I asked. 

"All these lessons from Amazon. You're constantly using them. Might as well capture them all in one place. I bet people would find them interesting. I know I would."

I decided to give it a try. I began roughly outline the concepts, lessons, strategies, and approaches I'd learned, observed, and practiced at Amazon. To my surprise, altough seven years had passed since I'd left the company, the content was all right there at the surface, ready to be transcribed and organized. Before long, I realized that the lessons had grouped themselves into fourteen leadership principles.

What makes Amazon's principles so unforgettable, even for a company alumnus who'd made no special effort to recall them? The answer has a lot to do with why Jeff Bezoz was so livid at my status report on merchant integration in that 2003 S-Team meeting. Amazon's leaders work hard to make their thinking very clear - to be clear not only about what they decide but precisely why they decide as they do. This quest for clarity has created an organization whose actions are based on a specific philosophy and consistent set of values and principles. It's a way to get the details right and scale the business successfully - something Amazon.com has arguably done better than any other company in history.

Encouraged by my colleague's suggestion, I decided to turn my notes into a book. I've deliberately kept it short and, I hope, enjoyable to read. A few years ago, I read with interest a story of a fifty-two-year-old Solvenian athlete who decided - who knows why? - to swim the length of the Amazon River. He survived 3,272 miles of exhaustion, sunburn, delirium, and piranhas to set a world record for distance swmming. While his journey up the Amazon was amazing feat, I don't want  yours to feel like a grueling test of endurance. Altough the story of Amazon.com is a continent-spanning tale of growth, innovation, and steadily increasing influence, the company's strategies, management techiniques, and approaches are both simple to understand and difficult to emulate. So I've strived to present them as clearly and directly as possible. Instead of a marathon swim through the muddy currents of business think, consider this book a riverboat tour with fourteen stops - one for each of the leadership principles.

Sit back and relax. I hope you enjoy the ride.
