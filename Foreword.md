​		We've all seen those ubiquitious company posters that pontificate about a company's mission, yet it is clear to all that no one, including the CEO, has read them, much less lived them.

​        Amazon is different. It inculcates its values in every meeting and in every process. They are the basis for its incredible success because they guide almost everything Amazon does.

​		Consequently, *The Amazon Way* is an insightful look at a very rare beast indeed, an American corporation that actually lives its values.

​		John Rossman didn't "grow up" at Amazon but rather came from the outside and had to quickly get up to speed on Amazon's "gladiator culture" and Jeff Bezoz's constant probing, questioning, and, yes, at times, screaming at his team.

​		Throught his experiences, you can learn how the team at Amazon obsesses over the customer, invents, simplifies, and think big while practicing frugality. He also explains how its values are supported by microscopic set of measurements and well-defined service level aggrements that instantly show when things veers off track.

​		Being an innovative company means you can never stop innovating. It means you must challenge the innovation that got you where you are today. Amazon faced a similar challenge when they decide to sell used books. A radical idea? Centainly. Did it upset the publishers who sold them books? Abosutely. But it was an idea that worked for comsumers, and paved the way for Amazon to create a multibillion-dollar third-party seller business.

​		We made a similar decision at American Airlines with the creation of Travelocity. Although we had multibillion-dollar business automating travel agents around the globe, we saw that future success required going direct to consumers with our own online travel agency. Travel agents were furious, but it was the right decision.

​		Innocators who change industries are not always easy to work for. Rossman's portrait of Bezoz reveals him as an innovator who is as irascible and creative as Henry Ford or Steve Jobs but one who at the same time has created an empire as complex and efficient as Sloane's GM or Crandall's American Airlines.

​		Having worked for Robert Crandall at American Airlines, I understand a boss with a towing temper and fanatical attention to detail, one who will take a customer call at midnight to find a lost wedding dress and then put his team through the wringer to find the root cause for the loss of the dress in the first place. I also konw how much I learned from working for such a leader.

​		Now you can learn from Bezoz and Amazon and put those lessons to work.
