We've all seen those ubiquitious company posters that pontificate about a company's mission, yet it is clear to all that no one, including the CEO, has read them, much less lived them.

我们都见过那些随处可见的公司海报，这些海报高调宣扬公司的使命，但所有人都清楚，包括 CEO 在内的所有人都没有读过它们，更不用说亲身体验了。

Amazon is different. It inculcates its values in every meeting and in every process. They are the basis for its incredible success because they guide almost everything Amazon does.

亚马逊则不同，它在每一次会议和每一个流程都在灌输其价值观。这些价值观成为其令人难以置信成功的基础，因为它们指导着亚马逊所做的几乎所有事情。

Consequently, *The Amazon Way* is an insightful look at a very rare beast indeed, an American corporation that actually lives its values.

因此，***亚马逊之道*** 是对一只罕见野兽的深刻剖析，它确实是一家真正践行其价值观的美国公司。

 John Rossman didn't "grow up" at Amazon but rather came from the outside and had to quickly get up to speed on Amazon's "gladiator culture" and Jeff Bezoz's constant probing, questioning, and, yes, at times, screaming at his team.

John Rossman（作者）并不是在亚马逊成长起来的，而是来自于其外部。他必须快速了解亚马逊的“角斗士”文化和杰夫贝索斯不断探索，质疑，并且有时对他的团队大喊大叫。

Throught his experiences, you can learn how the team at Amazon obsesses over the customer, invents, simplifies, and think big while practicing frugality. He also explains how its values are supported by microscopic set of measurements and well-defined service level aggrements that instantly show when things veers off track.

通过他的经历，您可以了解亚马逊的团队如何在实践节俭的同时痴迷客户、创新、简化并且大胆思考。他还解释了如何通过微观测量集和定义良好的SLA来支持这些价值，并且在事情偏离轨道时立刻显现出来。

Being an innovative company means you can never stop innovating. It means you must challenge the innovation that got you where you are today. Amazon faced a similar challenge when they decide to sell used books. A radical idea? Centainly. Did it upset the publishers who sold them books? Abosutely. But it was an idea that worked for comsumers, and paved the way for Amazon to create a multibillion-dollar third-party seller business.

作为一家创新型公司意味着你永远不能停止创新。这意味着你必须挑战那些使你走到今天的创新。亚马逊在决定出售二手书的时候也面临类似的挑战。这是一个激进的想法么？当然。这会让向他们出售书籍的出版商感到不安么？绝对会。但是这是一个对客户有用的想法，并且为亚马逊创造数十亿美元的三方买家业务铺平了道路。

We made a similar decision at American Airlines with the creation of Travelocity. Although we had multibillion-dollar business automating travel agents around the globe, we saw that future success required going direct to consumers with our own online travel agency. Travel agents were furious, but it was the right decision.

我们在美国航空公司通过创建Travelocity做出了类似的决定。尽管我们在全球拥有价值数十亿美元的自动化旅行社业务，但我们看到未来的成功需要我们自己的在线旅行社直接面向消费者。旅行社非常气愤，但这是正确的决定。

Innocators who change industries are not always easy to work for. Rossman's portrait of Bezoz reveals him as an innovator who is as irascible and creative as Henry Ford or Steve Jobs but one who at the same time has created an empire as complex and efficient as Sloane's GM or Crandall's American Airlines.

为改变行业的创新者工作并不是一件容易的事情。Rossman对贝佐斯的描述表明，他是像亨利.福特或者史蒂夫.乔布斯一样暴躁和富有创造力的创新者，但同时又创造了一个像斯隆的通用汽车或者克兰德尔的美国航空公司一样的复杂和高效的帝国。

Having worked for Robert Crandall at American Airlines, I understand a boss with a towing temper and fanatical attention to detail, one who will take a customer call at midnight to find a lost wedding dress and then put his team *through the wringer[1]* to find the root cause for the loss of the dress in the first place. I also konw how much I learned from working for such a leader.

通过在罗伯特.克兰德尔的美国航空公司的工作，使我了解了一位脾气暴躁、对细节狂热关注的老板，他会在午夜接到客户寻找丢失婚纱的电话，然后让他的团队精疲力尽地第一时间寻找丢失婚纱的根本原因。我也知道我能够从这样的领导者身上学到多少。

Now you can learn from Bezoz and Amazon and put those lessons to work.	

现在你可以向贝佐斯和亚马逊学习并付之实践。
