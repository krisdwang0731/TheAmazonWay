In 2009, Amazon.com acquired ecommerce footwear com- pany Zappos.com for $807 million in Amazon.com stock, plus about $40 million in cash and restricted stock.<sup>1</sup> While many were shocked by the deal, it made perfect sense to me—though not for the reason given in Jeff Bezos’s official statement, which read, “Zappos is a customer-focused company. We see great opportunities to learn from each other and create even better experiences for our customers.” While that is true, the primary organic connection between the two firms lies in their hiring policies.

2009 年，亚马逊以 8.07 亿美元的亚马逊股票以及约 4000 万美元的现金和限制性股票收购了电子商务鞋类公司 Zappos.com（美捷步）。<sup>1</sup> 虽然许多人对这笔交易感到震惊， 这对我来说是完全合理的—尽管不是因为杰夫贝索斯的官方声明中给出的原因，其中写道：“Zappos 是一家以客户为中心的公司。 我们看到了相互学习并为我们的客户创造更好体验的绝佳机会。” 虽然这是真的，但两家公司之间的主要有机联系在于他们的招聘政策。

Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh has become the latest standard bearer for a successful CEO-driven company culture. He has been quoted as saying that hiring mistakes had cost his orga- nization $100 million. In response, he implemented a fairly radical policy of paying new hires to quit. It’s a strategy that’s so counterintuitive yet so transparent in its thinking that I was immediately reminded of Jeff Bezos.

Zappos 首席执行官 Tony Hsieh 已成为成功的CEO驱动型公司文化的最新标杆。 有人引述他的话说，招聘错误使他的组织损失了1亿美元。 作为回应，他实施了一项相当激进的政策，即支付新员工离职费用。 这是一个如此违反直觉但思想如此透明的策略，以至于我立即想起了杰夫·贝佐斯（Jeff Bezos）。

What’s the thinking behind paying employees to quit? Pretty simple, really. It’s about testing for commitment. If you’re willing to take $2,000 to leave Zappos (which was the offer last time I checked), then you obviously haven’t bought into what the company is trying to do. I don’t know for sure, but I suspect that Hsieh’s gutsy “all-in” requirement from his employees was a major driver in Jeff’s decision to buy his company.

付钱给员工辞职背后的想法是什么？ 很简单，真的。 这是关于承诺的测试。 如果您愿意拿 2,000 美元离开 Zappos（这是我上次查看的报价），那么您显然还没有接受该公司正在尝试做的事情。 我不确定，但我怀疑 Hsieh 对员工的大胆“全身心投入”的要求是 Jeff 决定收购他的公司的主要驱动因素。

Jeff didn’t offer me money to leave Amazon at any point during my tenure, but (as I’ve mentioned) I did endure 23 in- terviews over six weeks before being hired in the first place. I’ve heard others compare the process to the oral exam that a Ph.D. candidate must survive. I don’t have a doctorate, but that sounds about right. The scrutiny is very, very intense. A typical interview day at Amazon can last nine hours. You may find yourself speaking to a group of people who will be working for you if you are hired. You may find yourself sitting in on a strategic meeting with company brass. You may be expected to contribute a solution to a real-time prob- lem. You may even be shown the door before you ever get started. This is a test of commitment that is very comparable to Zappos’s $2,000 exit offer and reflects the same belief in the crucial importance of hiring and retaining only the right people.

杰夫在我任职期间的任何时候都没有给过我离开亚马逊的钱，但是（正如我所提到的）我确实在六周内接受了 23 次面试，然后才被录用。 我听说其他人将这个过程比作博士学位的口试。 候选人必须生存。 我没有博士学位，但这听起来是对的。 审查非常非常严格。 亚马逊的典型面试日可以持续 9 个小时。 如果您被录用，您可能会发现自己与一群将为您工作的人交谈。 您可能会发现自己坐在公司高层的战略会议上。 您可能需要为实时问题提供解决方案。 您甚至可能在开始之前就被带进门。 这是对承诺的考验，与 Zappos 的 2,000 美元退出报价非常相似，反映了同样的信念，即只雇用和留住合适的人至关重要。

From the beginning, Jeff understood how important it was to seed Amazon with people who embodied the culture he wanted to create—that your people *are* your company. As a result, his standards are shockingly high. As Jeff often says, it’s better to let the perfect person go than to hire the wrong person and have to deal with the ramifications. Why? Because it is a difficult, time-consuming, and expensive pro- cess to get rid of a bad hire—and in the meantime, they are dragging down those around them by their failure to help keep the flywheel of continuous growth and improvement humming at full strength.

从一开始，Jeff 就明白让能够体现他想要创造的文化的人为亚马逊播种是多么重要——你的人*就是*你的公司。 结果，他的标准高得惊人。 正如杰夫经常说的那样，让完美的人离开比雇用错误的人并且不得不处理的后果要好。 为什么？ 因为摆脱一个糟糕的员工是一个困难、耗时且昂贵的过程——与此同时，他们因为未能全力帮助维持持续增长和改进的飞轮嗡嗡作响而拖累了周围的人。
