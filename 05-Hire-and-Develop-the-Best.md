# Hire and Develop the Best

In 2009, Amazon.com acquired ecommerce footwear com- pany Zappos.com for $807 million in Amazon.com stock, plus about $40 million in cash and restricted stock.<sup>1</sup> While many were shocked by the deal, it made perfect sense to me—though not for the reason given in Jeff Bezos’s official statement, which read, “Zappos is a customer-focused company. We see great opportunities to learn from each other and create even better experiences for our customers.” While that is true, the primary organic connection between the two firms lies in their hiring policies.

2009 年，亚马逊以 8.07 亿美元的亚马逊股票以及约 4000 万美元的现金和限制性股票收购了电子商务鞋类公司 Zappos.com（美捷步）。<sup>1</sup> 虽然许多人对这笔交易感到震惊， 这对我来说是完全合理的—尽管不是因为杰夫贝索斯的官方声明中给出的原因，其中写道：“Zappos 是一家以客户为中心的公司。 我们看到了相互学习并为我们的客户创造更好体验的绝佳机会。” 虽然这是真的，但两家公司之间的主要有机联系在于他们的招聘政策。

Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh has become the latest standard bearer for a successful CEO-driven company culture. He has been quoted as saying that hiring mistakes had cost his orga- nization $100 million. In response, he implemented a fairly radical policy of paying new hires to quit. It’s a strategy that’s so counterintuitive yet so transparent in its thinking that I was immediately reminded of Jeff Bezos.

Zappos 首席执行官 Tony Hsieh 已成为成功的CEO驱动型公司文化的最新标杆。 有人引述他的话说，招聘错误使他的组织损失了1亿美元。 作为回应，他实施了一项相当激进的政策，即支付新员工离职费用。 这是一个如此违反直觉但思想如此透明的策略，以至于我立即想起了杰夫·贝佐斯（Jeff Bezos）。

What’s the thinking behind paying employees to quit? Pretty simple, really. It’s about testing for commitment. If you’re willing to take $2,000 to leave Zappos (which was the offer last time I checked), then you obviously haven’t bought into what the company is trying to do. I don’t know for sure, but I suspect that Hsieh’s gutsy “all-in” requirement from his employees was a major driver in Jeff’s decision to buy his company.

付钱给员工辞职背后的想法是什么？ 很简单，真的。 这是关于承诺的测试。 如果您愿意拿 2,000 美元离开 Zappos（这是我上次查看的报价），那么您显然还没有接受该公司正在尝试做的事情。 我不确定，但我怀疑 Hsieh 对员工的大胆“全身心投入”的要求是 Jeff 决定收购他的公司的主要驱动因素。

Jeff didn’t offer me money to leave Amazon at any point during my tenure, but (as I’ve mentioned) I did endure 23 in- terviews over six weeks before being hired in the first place. I’ve heard others compare the process to the oral exam that a Ph.D. candidate must survive. I don’t have a doctorate, but that sounds about right. The scrutiny is very, very intense. A typical interview day at Amazon can last nine hours. You may find yourself speaking to a group of people who will be working for you if you are hired. You may find yourself sitting in on a strategic meeting with company brass. You may be expected to contribute a solution to a real-time prob- lem. You may even be shown the door before you ever get started. This is a test of commitment that is very comparable to Zappos’s $2,000 exit offer and reflects the same belief in the crucial importance of hiring and retaining only the right people.

杰夫在我任职期间的任何时候都没有给过我离开亚马逊的钱，但是（正如我所提到的）我确实在六周内接受了 23 次面试，然后才被录用。 我听说其他人将这个过程比作博士学位的口试。 候选人必须生存。 我没有博士学位，但这听起来是对的。 审查非常非常严格。 亚马逊的典型面试日可以持续 9 个小时。 如果您被录用，您可能会发现自己与一群将为您工作的人交谈。 您可能会发现自己坐在公司高层的战略会议上。 您可能需要为实时问题提供解决方案。 您甚至可能在开始之前就被带进门。 这是对承诺的考验，与 Zappos 的 2,000 美元退出报价非常相似，反映了同样的信念，即只雇用和留住合适的人至关重要。

From the beginning, Jeff understood how important it was to seed Amazon with people who embodied the culture he wanted to create—that your people *are* your company. As a result, his standards are shockingly high. As Jeff often says, it’s better to let the perfect person go than to hire the wrong person and have to deal with the ramifications. Why? Because it is a difficult, time-consuming, and expensive pro- cess to get rid of a bad hire—and in the meantime, they are dragging down those around them by their failure to help keep the flywheel of continuous growth and improvement humming at full strength.

从一开始，Jeff 就明白让能够体现他想要创造的文化的人为亚马逊播种是多么重要——你的人*就是*你的公司。 结果，他的标准高得惊人。 正如杰夫经常说的那样，让完美的人离开比雇用错误的人并且不得不处理的后果要好。 为什么？ 因为摆脱一个糟糕的员工是一个困难、耗时且昂贵的过程——与此同时，他们因为未能全力帮助维持持续增长和改进的飞轮嗡嗡作响而拖累了周围的人。

## Raising the Bar On Hiring

## 提高招聘标准

> 译者注： 在亚马逊，Bar这个词用的非常多，原意是跳高时候的横杆，Bar Raiser是指抬高横杆的人，因此，raise the bar在亚马逊特指不断地提高标准。因此下面的翻译将不直接翻译bar raiser这个词汇，而采用英文原文。

In the beginning, Jeff personally okayed every hire. After a few years, for obvious reasons, that became impos- sible to do. So in order to maintain his own high standards within the rapidly expanding organization, he created what he called the *bar raiser*.

一开始，杰夫亲自面试每一个员工。 几年后，由于显而易见的原因，这变得不可能。 因此，为了在快速扩张的组织中保持自己的高标准，他创造了他所谓的“抬高横杆的人”。

The bar raiser is an individual appointed to serve as the last line of defense to ensure Jeff’s standards of excellence. The bar raiser has veto power over any potential hire—regardless of the candidate’s pedigree or his popularity among the rest of the hiring group. The bar raiser’s job is to ensure that the next hire should increase the company’s collective IQ , capacity, and capability—not decrease it. He or she also has to gauge how “fungible” the candidate is—that is, how capable of expanding into new roles and new areas of the business. Jeff famously put the philosophy this way: Five years after an employee was hired, he said, that employee should think, “I’m glad I got hired when I did, because I wouldn’t get hired now.”<sup>2</sup>

Bar Raiser 是被任命为确保杰夫卓越标准的最后一道防线的人。 无论候选人的血统或他在招聘团队的其他成员中的受欢迎程度如何，标准制定者都拥有对任何潜在招聘的否决权。 bar raiser的工作是确保下一个雇员应该提高公司的集体智商、能力——而不是降低它。 他或她还必须衡量应聘者的“可替代性”——即扩展到新角色和新业务领域的能力。 杰夫有句名言：他说，在一名员工被聘用五年后，该员工应该想：“我很高兴我当初被聘用时被聘用，因为我现在不会被聘用<sup>2</sup>。

It’s quite an honor to be named a bar raiser. The selection is based on the success and retention of the hires you’ve already made. Yet in having a veto over hiring, the role often puts you in direct opposition to the team doing the hiring. As an outside voice, your job is be an independent force, free from the pressure of work demands that sometimes lead hiring teams to make hasty or short-sighted decisions.

被任命为bar raiser是一件荣耀的事情，被选为bar raiser是基于你在以前的招聘中的成功以及能够保持成功。在拥有否决权时，这个角色通常会让你站在招聘团队的对立面。 招聘团队由于工作压力有时会做出仓促和短视的决定，作为外部声音，您的工作是独立的，不受招聘团队的影响。

Even if you are not the bar raiser, your role in the hiring process is vital. Jeff would frequently tell us all that a hiring decision was probably the most important decision we could make as a member of the organization. We all knew that every successful candidate’s career was inextricably linked to our own. And this was, without a doubt, the most effective forcing function for excellence.

Another was our custom recruiting application, which forced every interviewer to provide a lengthy, narrative anal- ysis of the candidate and a yes-or-no recommendation (with no “maybe” option available). Your notes were expected to be detailed enough to justify your answer; the after-inter- view questioning could almost be as intense and consuming for the interviewer as it had been for the interviewee. The data was then immediately processed and applied to the next round of interviews. The process was so efficient that the next set of interviewers would often adapt their questions to push the candidate in directions suggested by answers they had provided just an hour or two earlier. As an interviewer, I sometimes forgot to listen to the candidate’s answers be- cause I was so busy directing my line of questioning to suit the previous interviewer’s data or scribbling madly to record everything said.

After the interviews were completed, the hiring man- ager and bar raiser would review the notes and the votes of every interview. If a debrief was required, it was mandatory that everyone attend. And, of course the bar raiser could veto the hire without question, no matter how the team or hiring manager felt.

It was an absurdly rigorous process, one that would be considered wildly excessive at almost any other company. But if you really believe that your people *are* your company,why not invest the time and effort required to identify and hire only the very best?

Because standards are so high, hiring can be problem- atic. What many people don’t realize is that Amazon.com almost went out of business in 2000, not long before I ar- rived. There was not enough revenue and way too much cost. The stock price plunged from $100 to $44 to $20 to below $5. The company closed down customer service, and massive layoffs ensued. Over the next few years, it was tremendously difficult to hire the best because we wouldn’t pay them what they deserved and the stock options were far from enticing. There was a lot of risk and we basically expected people to take a pay cut to join us.

Yet the incredible commitment to hiring only the best remained unwavering. One colleague of mine wasn’t able to find a suitable hire for over two months, so they just axed the position and told him that, if he hadn’t been able to make the hire, then he obviously didn’t need the person in the first place.

Of course, Amazon isn’t above taking advantage of short- cut methods for identifying great talent. In a 2012 *CNN Money* article, Adam Lashinsky explained how Amazon. com had gone on a “military hiring spree” because Jeff was impressed with veterans’ logistical know-how and bias for action.3 In fact, Amazon.com has a dedicated military re- cruiting website and a highly consistent hiring and retention record for ex-military personnel.

This practice of hiring veterans isn’t about expressing gratitude for ex-soldiers’ service to our country. Veterans fit Jeff’s business model. As a result, Amazon.com has not bothered to launch a huge PR campaign about its military employment program. Jeff just realized it was good business.

## The Passing Grade Is A

The kiss of death at Amazon.com is being known as a “solid guy.” While this might seem like a perfectly accept- able description at another company, Jeff’s perception was different. As far as he was concerned, everyone at Amazon is fortunate to be there. People who didn’t excel at their jobs were failing to contribute appropriately, in effect free-riding on the rest of us. As leaders, we were expected to work with laggards like these to improve their performance into the A+ category—or else find some way to incent these people to leave.

As a result, Amazon.com experienced systematic and significant turnover during my years there. Jeff told us to focus our positive reinforcement on our A+ people; he was comfortable with a high degree of churn below that standard.

This strategy was distinctly underlined by the compen- sation policy. At Amazon.com, the vast majority of stock op- tions go to the A+ employees; only the crumbs go to the B and C players. And since the salaries were, relatively speak- ing, quite low (I think the top salary at the time was $155k), a vast majority of our compensation came in the form of stock. So being “a solid B” meant a significant falloff in stock options and promotion opportunities. It was all part of Jeff’s way of instilling a sense of ownership in the company: our financial fortunes were directly tied to the success of the company.

Only seeking out, hiring, and retaining the very best people makes it possible to insist upon the highest standards of performance in the everyday activities of your company.
