# 4. Leaders are Right - A Lot

> Leaders at Amazon are right—not always, but a lot. They have strong business judgment, and they spread that strong judgment to others through the utter clarity with which they define their goals and the metrics they use to measure success.

Make no mistake; there is a high degree of tolerance forfailure at Amazon.com. A successful culture of innovation cannot exist without it. But what Jeff Bezos cannot tolerate is someone making the same mistake over and over again, or failing for the wrong reasons.

Therefore, leaders at Amazon are expected to be right far more often than they are wrong. And when they are wrong—which of course will happen when a company continually pushes the envelope, as Amazon does—they are expected to learn from their mistakes, develop specific insights into the reasons for those mistakes, and share those insights with the rest of the company.

The resulting culture of learning, growth, and accountability would be impossible without a high premium on *clarity* - clarity in the setting of goals, the communication of those goals throughout the organization, the establishment of metrics, and the use of those metrics in gauging the success or failure of any initiative. Practices like "fudging the numbers," "guesstimating," "approximating," and "bending the rules," as well as deadlines that aren't real deadlines and targets that are purely aspirational rather than firm objectives—all of these are anathema at Amazon.com.

As I’ve mentioned, one of the reasons I’m able to write out a description of Amazon’s fourteen leadership secrets eight years after I left the company is the exceptionally clear way we articulated our goals and processes as a team and as an organization. Great leaders (like Jeff Bezos) develop a strong, clear framework; then they constantly apply that framework and articulate it accurately to their team. Get this right from the outset and you’ve got an excellent mechanism for scaling good decision-making from top to bottom. 

Interestingly enough, as leaders at Amazon.com we were required to write out our ideas in a long, narrative form, which may seem contrary to the value of clarity. After all, don’t most business presentations involve a series of bullet-point PowerPoint slides that are supposed to boil down complex concepts into a handful of brief, vivid phrases?

But at Amazon, PowerPoint slides were not allowed. If you needed to explain a new feature or investment to the S-Team or Jeff himself, you began by writing a five to seven page ssay. After you finished that, you reviewed it and trimmed it down to maybe two pages of text for the executives. I can’t tell you how many of my weekends were consumed by this writing and editing process. Then, at the beginning of the meeting, you would pass out this narrative and sit quietly for ten minutes while everyone read it.

The two-page document was a useful tool for sharing a set of ideas with your colleagues. But even more important was the process of working on the plan or proposal, describing it in a narrative so that important nuances, principles, and features were clear is a critical goal. As Dwight D. Eisenhower said, “Plans are nothing; planning is everything”. Jeff believes that reliance on PowerPoint presentationsdumbs down the conversation and does not push teams to think all the way through their topic. As he explained in a 2013 Charlie Rose interview, “When you have to write your ideas out in complete sentences and complete paragraphs, it forces a deeper clarity of thinking.” By contrast, in the typical PowerPoint show, “You get very little information, you get bullet points. This is easy for the presenter, but difficult for the audience. "Written documents share more information without the need of additional explanation. When you have to be super specific, it further drives a culture of clarity, commitment, and accountability.

Jeff also believes that successful leaders, when presented with new evidence and data, are able to adapt their perspective. Accordingly, he looks for people who are constantly revising their understanding and circling back on problems they thought they’d already solved. He also looks for leaders who can maintain a remarkably granular understanding of their businesses through metrics, intensity, and great program execution. (It’s a principle I will further explore in Chapter 12, “Dive Deep.”) He believes that his system of corporate communication via written-out narratives will develop ideas much more effectively, deeply, and quickly than oversimplified bullet points and pie charts.



## The Future Press Release

The style and format of Amazon.com project vision statements offers another excellent example of the narrative as a forcing function. Written as a short, simple, clear, digestible narrative, the Amazon “future press release” creates very little wiggle room and holds the highlighted team’s feet to the fire by introducing specific parameters and deadlines that are expected to be met. So useful is this technique that an Amazon product launch almost always begins with what we used to call a future press release—an announcement of the product written before its development even began, used for internal purposes only. Crafting the future press release forced us to articulate for ourselves what would be newsworthy about the product at the very end of the development process.

This is a great way to define clear and lofty goals, requirements, and objectives, and to build broad understanding from the start of a program or enterprise change. Any time your organization is beginning to undertake a critical enterprise or competitive endeavor—launching a new product, undergoing a transformation, or entering a new market—writing a future press release is a great technique. Follow these rules to make them effective:

* Write the release as if you are writing at some future point in time where success has been achieved and realized. For example, when look- ing forward to the introduction of a new product, writing a press release as if at the day of product launch is good, but even better is a date sometime after launch, where true success can be discussed.
* Discuss why the initiative is important to cus- tomers or other key stakeholders. How did the customer experience improve? What benefits have customers received? Then discuss other rea- sons why it was important.
* Set audacious, clear, and measurable goals, in- cluding financial results, operating objectives, and market share.
* Outline the principles used that led to success. This is the trickiest and most important step. Describe the hard things accomplished, the im- portant decisions along the way, and the design principles that led to success.

The future press release is a type of forcing function. It paints a clear vision to galvanize understanding and com- mitment. Once it has been reviewed and approved, teams have a difficult time backing out of the promises it implies. As the project continues, a leader can refer to the press re- lease and use it to remind and hold teams accountable.

Here is the future press release we might have written in 2002 when launching the third-party selling business:

***Amazon Announces Huge Growth in Third-Party Selling, Delighting Customers and Sellers***

Seattle, WA: Amazon announced results for the third-party selling business today. Using the third-party selling platform, Amazon customers can now shop across many categories of products today including apparel, sporting goods, home decor, jewelry and electronics with incredible se- lection, price and an experience equaling orders fulfilled by Amazon.

“The Amazon customer now thinks about Amazon for any retail need, thanks to the third party selling business. Over 30% of all orders at Amazon are now third party sold and ful- filled orders, across 10 new and expanded prod- uct categories,” explained Director of Merchant Integration John Rossman. “We tackled several difficult hurdles to make this successful, with the key being that sellers had a great experience. Sellers can now register, list products to sell, take orders and fulfill in the middle of the night, with- out ever having to talk to someone at Amazon.”

If you want to increase your chances of achieving your goals when launching any important initiative, make sure you define and explain those goals with utter clarity from the very beginning. The future press release is a useful tool for making that happen.

## Clarity and the Culture of Performance

There is no hiding from your failures in a culture that holds people accountable for their metrics. As Manfred Bluemel, a former senior market researcher at Amazon, once said, “If you can stand a barrage of questions, then you have picked the right metric. But you had better have your stuff together. The best number wins.”<sup>2</sup>

Bluemel was referring to Amazon.com’s “gladiator cul- ture.” Because the numbers provide crystal-clear, incontro- vertible proof of which leaders are right a lot, Amazon.com operates to as close to a true meritocracy as possible. I cannot overstate how important this is for minimizing bureaucracy in the organization. When Jeff purchased *The Washington Post* in 2013, a reporter at the paper interviewed me about this cultural phenomenon at Amazon.com. I explained how key judgments were made during my years at the company: “It was not the title but rather who’s got the best idea. Who’s bringing the solution to the table? That’s what was most important.”<sup>3</sup>

To be blunt, as an Amazon.com leader, you don’t get the chance to make a lot of mistakes. Screw up for long enough, or for the wrong reasons, and the island will simply vote you off. It is the strongest culture of performance I have ever ex- perienced, and it is directly tied to metrics and results.

## “Did I Have a Good Day Today?” The Engineer’s Answer

At Amazon.com, having a balanced, well-engineered scorecard of metrics that is consistently reviewed day over day, week over week, provides deep insights into what works and what doesn’t. It also places sole responsibility for success and failure on you as a leader.

Repeatable, consistent performance reflected in metrics is the gold standard for success at Amazon. Without access to a consistent set of metrics, an Amazon.com leader would be flying blind, and such risky behavior is not acceptable at the company. Amazon.com relies on real-time metrics or in- strumentation more than any other company I have ever been involved with. Real data and real insights from the customer experience are used continually to answer the question, “Did I have a good day today?” If your metrics are in place, they are real-time, and your team and processes use them, this question yields a simple “yes” or “no” answer.

It takes foresight to do leadership-by-the-numbers cor- rectly. You must embed real-time metrics from the very start of a program, because they are nearly impossible to retrofit.

The Amazon experience shows us that the single biggest opportunity for companies operating today is to completely rethink their concept of metrics. Most companies use what’s called batch architecture to record large sets of transactions or other quantitative updates and to process them periodi- cally (daily or weekly is typical). Batch architecture is very last century. In this day and age, you need real-time data, real-time monitoring, and real-time alarms when trouble is brewing—not lag-time metrics that hide the real issues for 24 hours or longer. Your business should operate like a nuclear reactor. If a problem arises, you need to be aware immediately.

This is why the word *instrumentation* is useful. It gives a different feel than *metrics* or *business intelligence*. An airplane pilot needs accurate real-time data. There can be no latency because there is no “down time” in a plane. Introducing the concept of instrumentation was a big and important change at Amazon.com, closely tied to our commitment to application programming interfaces (APIs) and service-oriented archi- tectures (SOA). Instrumentation as a critical feature provided the dashboard to understand performance and issues in a real- time manner. In pursuit of true instrumentation, Amazon. com is constantly developing its real-time capabilities. During my time at the organization, Amazon.com tracked its perfor- mance against roughly 500 measurable goals, nearly 80 per- cent of which had to do with customer objectives.<sup>4</sup>

As I mentioned in Chapter 3, while I was heading up our third-party seller business, we decided we wanted the customers to have as much trust in buying from a third party as they did in buying from Amazon.com itself. Only because we embedded real-time instrumentation from the very outset could we ask a third-party seller, “Why aren’t you fulfilling this on time?” or “Why is this item available at your site but not through Amazon.com?” The key is that our measure- ment tools had to be actionable and very current—as close to real-time as possible. We started with the concept of “perfect orders,” already used in Amazon retail as a way of measuring seller performance. The specific metrics we developed to measure seller performance included:

*Order defect rate (ODR).* This is the percentage of a sell- er’s orders that have received negative feedback (such as a one-star or two-star customer rating), an A-to-Z Guarantee claim, or a service credit card chargeback request (when a customer disputes a credit card charge with his or her bank). ODR allows Amazon.com to measure overall performance with a single metric. Obviously, a seller who maintains a high percentage of negative feedback is failing to live up to Amazon.com’s customer-centric philosophy.<sup>5</sup>

*Pre-fulfillment cancellation rate.* This is the percentage of orders cancelled by a seller for any reason prior to shipment confirmation.

*Late shipment rate.* This is the percentage of orders with a shipment confirmation that is overdue by three or more days. Orders that are ship-confirmed late may lead to in- creased customer contacts and negatively impact customer experience.

*Refund rate.* This is the percentage of orders refunded by a seller for any reason.

All sellers should be working toward achieving and maintaining a level of customer service that meets the fol- lowing performance targets:

* Order defect rate: < 1%
* Pre-fulfillment cancel rate: < 2.5%
* Late shipment rate: < 4%

Failure to meet these targets often results in the removal of the individual’s selling privileges. Internally, seller metrics become bundled with even more measures of effectiveness and quality of seller performance, including customer ratings and the number of customer service contacts.<sup>6</sup>

Systems and software engineers will always be at the top of the food chain in a culture of innovation and metrics because they create the proprietary algorithms that enable leaders to have their fingers on the pulse of their businesses every second of the day. Jeff Bezos and Amazon have a deep belief that small teams of world-class engineers can out-in- novate massive bureaucracies. Why? It has a lot to do with the instinctive preference for clarity that engineers develop through a lifetime of working with numbers and system re- quirements. Whereas bureaucrats automatically obfuscate, engineers automatically clarify. Clarification is the Amazon way, and is the basis for the culture of accountability that Jeff prides himself on creating.
