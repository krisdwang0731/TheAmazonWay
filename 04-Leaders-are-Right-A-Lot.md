# 4. Leaders are Right - A Lot

> Leaders at Amazon are right—not always, but a lot. They have strong business judgment, and they spread that strong judgment  to others through the utter clarity with which they define their goals and the metrics they use to measure success.

Make no mistake;  there is a high degree of tolerance forfailure at Amazon.com. A successful culture of innovation cannot exist without it. But what Jeff  Bezos cannot tolerate is someone making the same mistake over and over again, or failing for the wrong reasons.

Therefore,  leaders at  Amazon are expected to be right far more often than they are wrong.  And when they are wrong—which of course will happen when a company continually pushes the envelope, as Amazon does—they are expected to learn from their mistakes, develop specific insights into the reasons for those mistakes, and share those insights with the rest of the company.

The resulting culture of learning, growth, and accountability would be impossible without a high premium on *clarity* - clarity in the setting of goals,  the communication of those goals throughout the organization, the establishment of metrics, and the use of those metrics in gauging the success or failure  of any initiative. Practices like "fudging the numbers," "guesstimating," "approximating,"  and  "bending the rules," as well as deadlines that aren't real deadlines and targets  that  are  purely  aspirational  rather  than  firm  objectives—all of these are anathema at Amazon.com.

As I’ve mentioned, one of the reasons I’m able to write out a description of Amazon’s fourteen leadership secrets eight years after I left the company is the exceptionally clear way we articulated our goals and processes as a team and as an organization. Great leaders (like Jeff Bezos) develop a  strong,  clear framework; then they constantly apply that framework and articulate it accurately to their team. Get this right from the outset and you’ve got an excellent mechanism for scaling good decision-making from top to bottom. 

Interestingly enough, as leaders at Amazon.com we were required  to  write out our ideas in a long, narrative form, which may seem contrary to the  value of clarity.  After all, don’t most business presentations involve a series of bullet-point PowerPoint slides that are supposed to boil down complex concepts into a handful of brief, vivid phrases?
