# 4. Leaders are Right - A Lot

# 4. 决策正确

> Leaders at Amazon are right—not always, but a lot. They have strong business judgment, and they spread that strong judgment to others through the utter clarity with which they define their goals and the metrics they use to measure success.
>
> 亚马逊的领导者大多数情况下能够做出正确的决定。他们具有很强的商业判断力，并通过明确定义目标和衡量成功的指标，将这种判断力传播给他人。

Make no mistake; there is a high degree of tolerance forfailure at Amazon.com. A successful culture of innovation cannot exist without it. But what Jeff Bezos cannot tolerate is someone making the same mistake over and over again, or failing for the wrong reasons.

不犯错误；亚马逊对于失败的容忍度很高。没有它，就不可能存在成功的创新文化。但是，杰夫贝佐斯不能容忍的是有人一遍又一遍地犯同样的错误，或者因为错误的原因而失败。

Therefore, leaders at Amazon are expected to be right far more often than they are wrong. And when they are wrong—which of course will happen when a company continually pushes the envelope, as Amazon does—they are expected to learn from their mistakes, develop specific insights into the reasons for those mistakes, and share those insights with the rest of the company.

因此，在亚马逊希望领导者正确的次数远多于错误的次数。当他们犯错时—这当然会发生在公司不断挑战极限时，就像亚马逊一样—他们被期望从错误中吸取教训，对这些错误的原因形成具体的见解，并与公司的其他人分享这些见解。

The resulting culture of learning, growth, and accountability would be impossible without a high premium on *clarity* - clarity in the setting of goals, the communication of those goals throughout the organization, the establishment of metrics, and the use of those metrics in gauging the success or failure of any initiative. Practices like "fudging the numbers," "guesstimating," "approximating," and "bending the rules," as well as deadlines that aren't real deadlines and targets that are purely aspirational rather than firm objectives—all of these are anathema at Amazon.com.

如果不高度重视*清晰度*，就不可能形成学习、成长和问责的文化——明确目标设定、在整个组织内传达这些目标、建立度量标准，以及在组织中使用这些度量标准衡量任何计划的成败。 诸如“捏造数字”、“猜测”、“近似”和“扭曲规则”等做法，以及并非真正的截止日期和纯粹只是雄心壮志而非确定目标的目标——所有这些在亚马逊都令人厌恶。（译者注：所谓雄心壮志的目标在亚马逊是指不负责任的过渡承诺或者没有经过调研的拍脑袋的决定，例如，没有任何证据的倒排期等）

As I’ve mentioned, one of the reasons I’m able to write out a description of Amazon’s fourteen leadership secrets eight years after I left the company is the exceptionally clear way we articulated our goals and processes as a team and as an organization. Great leaders (like Jeff Bezos) develop a strong, clear framework; then they constantly apply that framework and articulate it accurately to their team. Get this right from the outset and you’ve got an excellent mechanism for scaling good decision-making from top to bottom. 

正如我所提到的，在我离开公司八年后，我能够写出对亚马逊十四个领导秘诀的描述的原因之一是我们以非常清晰的方式阐明了我们作为一个团队和一个组织的目标和流程。 伟大的领导者（如杰夫·贝佐斯）制定了一个强大、清晰的框架； 然后他们不断地应用该框架并将其准确地表达给他们的团队。 从一开始就做到这一点，你就有了一个很好的机制来从上到下扩展良好的决策。

Interestingly enough, as leaders at Amazon.com we were required to write out our ideas in a long, narrative form, which may seem contrary to the value of clarity. After all, don’t most business presentations involve a series of bullet-point PowerPoint slides that are supposed to boil down complex concepts into a handful of brief, vivid phrases?

有趣的是，作为 Amazon.com 的领导者，我们被要求以长篇大论的形式写出我们的想法，这似乎与清晰的价值背道而驰。 毕竟，大多数商业演示不是都包含一系列要点 PowerPoint 幻灯片，这些幻灯片应该将复杂的概念归结为一些简短、生动的短语吗？

But at Amazon, PowerPoint slides were not allowed. If you needed to explain a new feature or investment to the S-Team or Jeff himself, you began by writing a five to seven page ssay. After you finished that, you reviewed it and trimmed it down to maybe two pages of text for the executives. I can’t tell you how many of my weekends were consumed by this writing and editing process. Then, at the beginning of the meeting, you would pass out this narrative and sit quietly for ten minutes while everyone read it.

但是在亚马逊不允许使用 PowerPoint 幻灯片。 如果您需要向 S-Team或杰夫本人解释新功能或投资，您可以先写一篇五到七页的文章。 完成后，您对其进行了审查并将其剪裁为两页文本供高管使用。 我无法告诉你我有多少周末被这个写作和编辑过程消耗了。 然后，在会议开始时，您将分发这个故事并安静地坐十分钟，让每个人都阅读它。

The two-page document was a useful tool for sharing a set of ideas with your colleagues. But even more important was the process of working on the plan or proposal, describing it in a narrative so that important nuances, principles, and features were clear is a critical goal. As Dwight D. Eisenhower said, “Plans are nothing; planning is everything”. Jeff believes that reliance on PowerPoint presentationsdumbs down the conversation and does not push teams to think all the way through their topic. As he explained in a 2013 Charlie Rose interview, “When you have to write your ideas out in complete sentences and complete paragraphs, it forces a deeper clarity of thinking.” By contrast, in the typical PowerPoint show, “You get very little information, you get bullet points. This is easy for the presenter, but difficult for the audience. "Written documents share more information without the need of additional explanation. When you have to be super specific, it further drives a culture of clarity, commitment, and accountability.

这份两页的文档是与同事分享一系列想法的有用工具。但更重要的是制定计划或提案的过程，在叙述中描述它以便清楚重要的细微差别、原则和特征是一个关键目标。正如德怀特·D·艾森豪威尔 (Dwight D. Eisenhower) 所说：“计划无足轻重；计划就是一切”。 Jeff 认为对 PowerPoint 演示文稿的依赖会使对话变得模糊，并且不会促使团队对他们的主题进行全面思考。正如他在 2013 年 Charlie Rose 采访中解释的那样，“当你必须用完整的句子和完整的段落写出你的想法时，它会迫使你更清晰地思考。”相比之下，在典型的 PowerPoint 展示中，“你得到的信息很少，你得到的只是要点。这对演讲者来说很容易，但对观众来说却很难“。 书面文件无需额外解释即可分享更多信息。当您必须非常具体时，它会进一步推动清晰、承诺和问责制的文化。

Jeff also believes that successful leaders, when presented with new evidence and data, are able to adapt their perspective. Accordingly, he looks for people who are constantly revising their understanding and circling back on problems they thought they’d already solved. He also looks for leaders who can maintain a remarkably granular understanding of their businesses through metrics, intensity, and great program execution. (It’s a principle I will further explore in Chapter 12, “Dive Deep.”) He believes that his system of corporate communication via written-out narratives will develop ideas much more effectively, deeply, and quickly than oversimplified bullet points and pie charts.

杰夫还认为，成功的领导者在获得新的证据和数据时，能够调整他们的观点。 因此，他寻找那些不断修正自己的理解并重新思考他们认为已经解决的问题的人。 他还寻找能够通过指标、强度和出色的计划执行对其业务保持非常细致的了解的领导者。 （这是我将在第 12 章“深入研究”中进一步探讨的原则。）他认为，与过于简化的要点和饼图相比，通过书面叙述的企业沟通系统将更有效、深入和快速地提出想法。



## The Future Press Release

## 未来新闻稿

The style and format of Amazon.com project vision statements offers another excellent example of the narrative as a forcing function. Written as a short, simple, clear, digestible narrative, the Amazon “future press release” creates very little wiggle room and holds the highlighted team’s feet to the fire by introducing specific parameters and deadlines that are expected to be met. So useful is this technique that an Amazon product launch almost always begins with what we used to call a future press release—an announcement of the product written before its development even began, used for internal purposes only. Crafting the future press release forced us to articulate for ourselves what would be newsworthy about the product at the very end of the development process.

This is a great way to define clear and lofty goals, requirements, and objectives, and to build broad understanding from the start of a program or enterprise change. Any time your organization is beginning to undertake a critical enterprise or competitive endeavor—launching a new product, undergoing a transformation, or entering a new market—writing a future press release is a great technique. Follow these rules to make them effective:

* Write the release as if you are writing at some future point in time where success has been achieved and realized. For example, when look- ing forward to the introduction of a new product, writing a press release as if at the day of product launch is good, but even better is a date sometime after launch, where true success can be discussed.
* Discuss why the initiative is important to cus- tomers or other key stakeholders. How did the customer experience improve? What benefits have customers received? Then discuss other rea- sons why it was important.
* Set audacious, clear, and measurable goals, in- cluding financial results, operating objectives, and market share.
* Outline the principles used that led to success. This is the trickiest and most important step. Describe the hard things accomplished, the im- portant decisions along the way, and the design principles that led to success.

The future press release is a type of forcing function. It paints a clear vision to galvanize understanding and com- mitment. Once it has been reviewed and approved, teams have a difficult time backing out of the promises it implies. As the project continues, a leader can refer to the press re- lease and use it to remind and hold teams accountable.

Here is the future press release we might have written in 2002 when launching the third-party selling business:

***Amazon Announces Huge Growth in Third-Party Selling, Delighting Customers and Sellers***

Seattle, WA: Amazon announced results for the third-party selling business today. Using the third-party selling platform, Amazon customers can now shop across many categories of products today including apparel, sporting goods, home decor, jewelry and electronics with incredible se- lection, price and an experience equaling orders fulfilled by Amazon.

“The Amazon customer now thinks about Amazon for any retail need, thanks to the third party selling business. Over 30% of all orders at Amazon are now third party sold and ful- filled orders, across 10 new and expanded prod- uct categories,” explained Director of Merchant Integration John Rossman. “We tackled several difficult hurdles to make this successful, with the key being that sellers had a great experience. Sellers can now register, list products to sell, take orders and fulfill in the middle of the night, with- out ever having to talk to someone at Amazon.”

If you want to increase your chances of achieving your goals when launching any important initiative, make sure you define and explain those goals with utter clarity from the very beginning. The future press release is a useful tool for making that happen.

## Clarity and the Culture of Performance

There is no hiding from your failures in a culture that holds people accountable for their metrics. As Manfred Bluemel, a former senior market researcher at Amazon, once said, “If you can stand a barrage of questions, then you have picked the right metric. But you had better have your stuff together. The best number wins.”<sup>2</sup>

Bluemel was referring to Amazon.com’s “gladiator cul- ture.” Because the numbers provide crystal-clear, incontro- vertible proof of which leaders are right a lot, Amazon.com operates to as close to a true meritocracy as possible. I cannot overstate how important this is for minimizing bureaucracy in the organization. When Jeff purchased *The Washington Post* in 2013, a reporter at the paper interviewed me about this cultural phenomenon at Amazon.com. I explained how key judgments were made during my years at the company: “It was not the title but rather who’s got the best idea. Who’s bringing the solution to the table? That’s what was most important.”<sup>3</sup>

To be blunt, as an Amazon.com leader, you don’t get the chance to make a lot of mistakes. Screw up for long enough, or for the wrong reasons, and the island will simply vote you off. It is the strongest culture of performance I have ever ex- perienced, and it is directly tied to metrics and results.

## “Did I Have a Good Day Today?” The Engineer’s Answer

At Amazon.com, having a balanced, well-engineered scorecard of metrics that is consistently reviewed day over day, week over week, provides deep insights into what works and what doesn’t. It also places sole responsibility for success and failure on you as a leader.

Repeatable, consistent performance reflected in metrics is the gold standard for success at Amazon. Without access to a consistent set of metrics, an Amazon.com leader would be flying blind, and such risky behavior is not acceptable at the company. Amazon.com relies on real-time metrics or in- strumentation more than any other company I have ever been involved with. Real data and real insights from the customer experience are used continually to answer the question, “Did I have a good day today?” If your metrics are in place, they are real-time, and your team and processes use them, this question yields a simple “yes” or “no” answer.

It takes foresight to do leadership-by-the-numbers cor- rectly. You must embed real-time metrics from the very start of a program, because they are nearly impossible to retrofit.

The Amazon experience shows us that the single biggest opportunity for companies operating today is to completely rethink their concept of metrics. Most companies use what’s called batch architecture to record large sets of transactions or other quantitative updates and to process them periodi- cally (daily or weekly is typical). Batch architecture is very last century. In this day and age, you need real-time data, real-time monitoring, and real-time alarms when trouble is brewing—not lag-time metrics that hide the real issues for 24 hours or longer. Your business should operate like a nuclear reactor. If a problem arises, you need to be aware immediately.

This is why the word *instrumentation* is useful. It gives a different feel than *metrics* or *business intelligence*. An airplane pilot needs accurate real-time data. There can be no latency because there is no “down time” in a plane. Introducing the concept of instrumentation was a big and important change at Amazon.com, closely tied to our commitment to application programming interfaces (APIs) and service-oriented archi- tectures (SOA). Instrumentation as a critical feature provided the dashboard to understand performance and issues in a real- time manner. In pursuit of true instrumentation, Amazon. com is constantly developing its real-time capabilities. During my time at the organization, Amazon.com tracked its perfor- mance against roughly 500 measurable goals, nearly 80 per- cent of which had to do with customer objectives.<sup>4</sup>

As I mentioned in Chapter 3, while I was heading up our third-party seller business, we decided we wanted the customers to have as much trust in buying from a third party as they did in buying from Amazon.com itself. Only because we embedded real-time instrumentation from the very outset could we ask a third-party seller, “Why aren’t you fulfilling this on time?” or “Why is this item available at your site but not through Amazon.com?” The key is that our measure- ment tools had to be actionable and very current—as close to real-time as possible. We started with the concept of “perfect orders,” already used in Amazon retail as a way of measuring seller performance. The specific metrics we developed to measure seller performance included:

*Order defect rate (ODR).* This is the percentage of a sell- er’s orders that have received negative feedback (such as a one-star or two-star customer rating), an A-to-Z Guarantee claim, or a service credit card chargeback request (when a customer disputes a credit card charge with his or her bank). ODR allows Amazon.com to measure overall performance with a single metric. Obviously, a seller who maintains a high percentage of negative feedback is failing to live up to Amazon.com’s customer-centric philosophy.<sup>5</sup>

*Pre-fulfillment cancellation rate.* This is the percentage of orders cancelled by a seller for any reason prior to shipment confirmation.

*Late shipment rate.* This is the percentage of orders with a shipment confirmation that is overdue by three or more days. Orders that are ship-confirmed late may lead to in- creased customer contacts and negatively impact customer experience.

*Refund rate.* This is the percentage of orders refunded by a seller for any reason.

All sellers should be working toward achieving and maintaining a level of customer service that meets the fol- lowing performance targets:

* Order defect rate: < 1%
* Pre-fulfillment cancel rate: < 2.5%
* Late shipment rate: < 4%

Failure to meet these targets often results in the removal of the individual’s selling privileges. Internally, seller metrics become bundled with even more measures of effectiveness and quality of seller performance, including customer ratings and the number of customer service contacts.<sup>6</sup>

Systems and software engineers will always be at the top of the food chain in a culture of innovation and metrics because they create the proprietary algorithms that enable leaders to have their fingers on the pulse of their businesses every second of the day. Jeff Bezos and Amazon have a deep belief that small teams of world-class engineers can out-in- novate massive bureaucracies. Why? It has a lot to do with the instinctive preference for clarity that engineers develop through a lifetime of working with numbers and system re- quirements. Whereas bureaucrats automatically obfuscate, engineers automatically clarify. Clarification is the Amazon way, and is the basis for the culture of accountability that Jeff prides himself on creating.
