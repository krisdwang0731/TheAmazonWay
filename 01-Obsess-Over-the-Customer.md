# 1. Obsess Over the Customer

> Leaders at Amazon start with the customer and work backwards, seeking continually to earn and keep teh customer's trust. Although leaders pay attention to their competitors, they obsess over their customers.

Jeff Bezoz's customer obsession is really something beyongd a mere obsession - it's a psychosis that has generated many of his most vitriolic tirades or, many often, sarcastic comments directed at Amazon associates who have fallen short of his own standard for customer service.  It steams from Jeff's unique ability to put himself in the customer's position, deduce his or her unspoken needs and wants, and then develop a system that will meet those needs and wants better than anyone else has ever done.

杰夫·贝佐斯 (Jeff Bezoz) 对客户的痴迷真的不仅仅是一种痴迷——这种偏执导致了他的许多最尖刻的长篇大论，或者经常是针对未达到他自己的客户服务标准的亚马逊员工的讽刺评论。 它源于杰夫的独特能力，他将自己置于客户的位置，推断出他或她未说出口的需求和愿望，然后开发出一个比任何人都做得更好的系统来满足这些需求和愿望。

This approach to business is at the core of Jeff's genius. Long before social media revolutionized the retail world with its vast, transparent networks linking companies, customers, prospects, and detractors; long before companies like Zappos.com made customer service the fundation of their business model; and even long before Jeff had fully realized his own vison for Amazon.com, he had profoundly internalized two truths about customer service:

* When a company makes a customer unhappy, that customer won't tell a friend or two or three... he or she will tell many, many more; and 
* The best customer service is *no* customer service - because the best experience happens when the customer never has to asky for help at all.

Of caurse, an actual business model that doesn't require *any* customer service is about as realistic as a perpetual motion machine. But very early in the Internet revolution, Jeff saw that the online-retail model raised the bar of that was possible. He long recognized that the biggest threat to the customer experience was human beings getting involved and mucking things up. The logical corollary was that the key to creating the most pleasant, frictionless customer experience possible was minimizing human involvement through process innovation and technology.

(Of course, Amazon still needs human beings. Throughout this book, I will discuss the techniques Jeff developed to help him hire, evaluate, and retain the very best talent in the world. But Amazon's goal has always been to minimize the time and energy its talented people must spend on routine service interactions, freeing them to innovate new ways to delight the customer.)

Jeff's insight let to some counterintuitive tactics. Back in the late 1990s, Amazon.com made it intentionally difficult for customers to find the customer service number, which confused some observers who thought this reflected an attitude of disdain for customers. But thoese customers quickly realized that Jeff's engineers had created a robust technology that enabled them to deal with their service request almost instantaneously with no human intervention. This wasn't as difficult as it might sound. After all, 98 percent of all customer questions at a retailer like Amazon boils down to, "Where is my staff?" An online tracking tool that lets the customer follow a shipment from the warehouse to his or her front door eliminates the need for a large, constly call center and the vast amounts of organizational friction it generates.

Jeff believed that people don't actually like to talk to customer service representatives. He was right. All he had to do was provide the data and tools and retrain customers to answer their own questions. Now customers have come to expect and demand effortless self-service customer care technology, a concept explained by Bill Price and David Jaffe in their 2008 book, *The Best Servie is No Service:* the more frictionless the experience , the more loyal the customer, and the lower the control costs. And this includes marketing and advertising costs. Price and Jaffe explain, "Amazon has enjoyed a 90 percent reduction in it CPO [contracts per order], meaning that it cloud keep customer care costs(head count and associated operational expenses) flat with a 9x increase in orders(revenues), a major contributor to the company's profitability beginning in 2002."<sup>1</sup>

The best customer service just works, without effort - producing incredible benefit both for customers and for the company that serves them. Take, for example, Amazon.com's revolutionary free shipping program, launched in November, 2000. It was originally called the "Free Super Save Shipping Offer" and was good only for orders over one hundred dollars. Instead of paying for advertising, Amazon.com pumped its money into free shipping, which resulted in customer-driven word of mouth, the world's most effective (and cheapest) form of advertising. This created a virtuous cycle: be sacrificing short-term financials for customer benefit, the strategy drove long-term competitive and financial benefits. "In the old world, you devoted 30 percent of your time to building a great service and 70 percent of your time to shouting about it," Jeff explained. "In the new world, that inverts."<sup>2</sup>

At the time, free shipping seemed like a wildly radical and risky strategy. Now customers expect it. In fact, most people assume that companies will pay for treturn shipiing as well - just one of the ways Amazon has raised the bar on customer service for countless businesses.



## The Virtuous Cycle Goes Fractal: The Flywheel Effect

Allen Mandelbrot founde the field of fractal mathematics, which studies (among other phenomena) how patterns in nature have a tendency to repeat themselves at different scales - for example, the way spiral galaxies resemble whorling seashells, which in turn resumble tiny unfurling fern fronts. In as similar fractal fashing, the virtuous cycle is replicated throughout Amazon.com at macro and micro levels. It generates a set of self-reinforcing energies that continue to flow even when the energy source is discoutinuous - much like a flywheel, which is the favorite metaphor for this phenomenon at Amazon.com.

Here's macro example of how the flywheel effect works (see Figure 1.1). Jeff doesn't focus on margins. He's more focused on free cash flow - that is, the cash that a company is able to generate after laying out the money required to maintain or expand its asset base. Why? Because he believes the Internet's potential for growth is gargantuan and still fundamentally unexploited. To Jeff, the year in 1889, and the Oklahoma Land Rush is on - or, as he likes to put it, it's still Day 1 of the Internet. So he's ready to slash prices and create programs like free shipping to cultivate customer loyalty and drive sales growth toward the unimaginable heights he foresees. Then he invests the revenue generated back into "the holy trinity": price, selection, and availibility (more on the later).

Sometimes, the lever you need to pull in order to create the flywheel effect can be sticky and difficult to budge. The effort involved can be costly, even painful. Jeff and the company's stockholders had to be willing to sacrifice a lot at the very beginning, so long as the customer experience was the primary beneficiary. Not every CEO has the stomach this requires. But Jeff's readiness to pay the price has produced much of Amazon's success.

In July, 1999, Jeff decide to move Amazon into the electronics business. The company was making a lot of money on book sales, but he knew that the push into electronics would be the first big step into a limitless world of new markets. Critics doubted it would work. Many said that customers needed to physically see and touch the equipment in a showroom and learn how to operate it with help from trained professionals. These cirtics - including many at  leading manufactures like Sony, as well as analysts on Wall Street - needed to be convinced that Amazon.com was capable of selling electronics at a hight volume and as an "Everyday Low Price" leader. Until they were won over, Amazon's electronics business would face tough sledding, including a cost structure much too high for tme modest salves it would initially generate.

Many retalers aren't willing to operate in the red for a while. Jeff was. And although it was ugly for a number of quarters (seemingly validating the warring of the doubters on Wall Street), by providing enough information and a frictionless return process, Amazon.com eventually built the type of volume that convinced the vendors and big-name manufacturers that people would buy complicated technology online. Jeff had wagered that his customers were intelligent enough to figure out electronics on their own - and he had won.

Once that flywheel was engaged, the energy generated was huge. Amazon.com's success in the electronics market kicked off a virtuous cycly of expanding e-commerce markets that continues to spin to this day.



## The Holy Trinity

Amazon.com's strategy includes greate pricing on virtually every product it sells. But the strategy is not just about price. A wide selection and fast, convenient availability with great delivery and service are equally critical elements of long-term customer needs. Price, selction, and availability... these are the three durable and universal customer desires that Amazon thinks of as its holy trinity.

Offer everything, get it cheaper, and make it more easily available. Fashions, tastes, product types, and form factors change, but the holy trinity won't. That's why Jeff Bezoz embraced this strategy from the earliest days of Amazon. Here's an excerpt from his very first letter to Amazon's shareholders in 1997:

​		From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our cusomters compelling value. We realized that Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. 		Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply cloud not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them 		much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-        		search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping 		    		experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click(SM) shopping, and vastly more reviews, 		contents, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth 		  		remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat pruchases   		and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.<sup>3</sup>

Price, selection, and availability - all the elements of the holy trinity are there. Incidentally, Jeff has attached this original 1997 shareholder letter to the back of every shareholder he has written since. And he repeats the some mantra every change he gets. In 2004, I accompanied Jeff when he gave a talk to the leadership team at Target, the large retailer. Jeff's message: he could never imagine a day when he customer would want higher prices, less selection, or a more complex and difficult transaction process. The holy trinity is eternal and must never be forgotten.

Let's take a closer look at the three elements of the holy trinity and consider how Amazon has built its business around each one.

***Price***. Amazon's low-price strategy is well documented. For nearly two decades, Jeff has proven that he is willing to make less on an item - or an entire line of products - in the short term to guarantee the long-term growth of the business. Yet Jeff's obsession with pricing knows no bounds. Here's an example:

During my years at Amazon, everyone understood that our goal was to be an Everyday Low Price leader. To do that, we had to make sure our prices matched those of our image competitors - Walmart, Best Buy, and Target. During one S-Team meeting, someone opined, "If the retailer with ehe lowest price doesn't have the item in stock, then we shouldn't match price. Why bleed the margin for no reason?"

Jeff immediately objected, pointing out how this might backfire. If customers saw that our price was higher, they'd grudgingly buy an item unavailable elsewhere - but the transaction would leave a bitter taste in thier mouth that they would associate with Amazon.com. Jeff rejected the idea of protecing our profit margin, emphasizing that what really mattered was what customers were thinking.

Of course, a low-margin pricing strategy is constantly usder siege. Most recently, the pressure has been coming from some very unlikely competitors - brick-and-martar retailers. An analyst for BB&T Capital Markets make waves in the media when he reported that the prices charged by retailer Bed Bath & Beyond on representative "basket" on thirty items had fallen from 9 percent higher than those charged by Amazon (in early 2012) to 6.5 percent lower than Amazon's (as of August 2013).<sup>4</sup> Other traditional retailers, such as Best Buy, are offering guarantees to match Amazon's pricing. Thanks to factors such as falling real estate prices, the gradual leveling of the sales tax playing field between online and offline retailers, and the greater leeway to reduce prices among old-school merchants with healthy profit margins (like those currently enjoyed by Bed Bath & Beyond), Amazon's once-huge price advantage over brick-and-mortar retailers is fading. How Amazon will respond to this intensified competition is one of the big questions for the company's future.

***Selection***. From the beginning, Jeff Bezoz's goal was to make Amazon a source for virtually anything a customer might want to buy, starting with an unmatched assortment of books and other media products and then expanded to include a practically unlimited array of goods.

Of course, trying to become "the everything store" (as described in the title of Brad Stone's excellent 2013 book about Amazon's history) is far from easy. When Jeff couldn't figure out how to organically scale Amazon.com to provide the vast assortment of products he envisioned, the idear of the third-party marketplace was formed. The world was full of people already selling everything under the sun. Jeff hired me to figure out a way to cohabitate with them under the umbrella of the Amazon.com brand (see charpter 7, "Think Big"). Long story short, we eventually figured out how to sell everything without carrying a huge hold of inventory or the risk that goes with it.

Today, the sacle at which Amazon.com operates is nearly infinite, provding a richness and variety of customer experience that would have seemed impossible a few years ago. What are you looking for? Uranium? Check. A fresh, whole rabbit? Sure. Bacon-shaped Band-Aids? Roger that. If you can imagine it, chances are it can be purchased on Amazon.com. And the more out-of-the-ordinary products customers discover when they browse Amazon's site, the more they make it their default location for any shopping they want to do, making the flywheel spin even faster.

***Availability***. Any time Amazon takes a customer's order, it offers a projected arrival time for the package using the Amazon-speak term, "the Promise." Why the heavy language? Because Jeff knows that in business, there are heavy consequences for those who don't have an item or can't get it to a customer quickly. Woe to those who fail to honor any element of the holy trinity - including convenient, timely availability. 

One year, we ordered four thousand pinki iPods from Apple fro Christmas. In mid-November, an Apple rep contacted us to say, "Problem - we can't make Christmas delivery. They're trasitioning from a disk drive to a hard-drive memory in the iPods, and they don't want to make any more using the old technology. Once we get the new ones made, we'll get you your four thousand. But it won't be in time for the holiday."

Other retailers would have simple apologized to their customers for the failure to deliver a product on time. That wasn't going to fly at Amazon.com. We were not the kind of company that ruined people's Christmases because of a lack of availability - not under any circumstances. So we went out and bought for thousand pink iPods *at retail* and had them all shipped to our Union Street office. Then we hand-sorted them, repacked them, and shipped them to the warehouse to be packaged and sent to our customers. It killed our margins on those iPods, but it enabled us to keep our promise to our customers.

During the next weekly business review, we had to explain to Jeff what we were doing and why. He just nodded approving and said, "I hope you'll get in touch with Apple and try to get our money back from the bastards." Ultimately, Apple did grudgingly split the cost difference with us. But even if they hadn't, it still have been right thing for Amazon to do.



## Serving the Customer: The Andon Cord

The Andon Cord is not a unique Amazon concept: it is an idea borrowed from Japanese lean manufacturing. My Amazon colleague, Clifford Cancelosi, was in the room when the concept was originally adapted for use at Amazon. It's a lean manufacturing principle most famously used in car manufacturing. Say you're working in a busy Toyota assembly plant, and you notice that the widget you're installing doesn't fit or is broken. You immediately reach up and pull the Andon Cord, stopping the assembly line and firing an inspection so that the defect can be ferreted out quickly. As consulant Todd Wangsgard explains, "The andon cord is literally a cord that workers can pull - a cord they should pull - any time something in the manufacturing process goes wrong that would compromise the quality of the product or safety of the people. The line stops immediately."<sup>5</sup>

The Amazon version of the Andon Cord started with a conversation about a customer care problem during a weekly business review. The issue centered on the way mistakes make by one set of employees - those working in the retail group - were creating headaches for a different set - those in the customer care department. "When the people in the retail group don't provide the right data for the customer, or enter a product description that's inaccurate," the head of customer care explained, "the customer is disappointed with the purchase. And that means they call customer care. which lands us with the hassle of refunding the product."

We discussed the problem and left the folks in the retail group with some action items intended to fix it. But a couple of weeks later, customers reported that nothing had improved.

Frustrated, the customer care group took matters into their own hands, createing their own version of the Andon Cord. When customers began complaining about a problem with a product, customer care simply took that product down from the website and sent a message to the retail group that said, in effect, "Fix the defect, or you can't sell this product." Needless to say, in the world of retail, halting the sale of a product is a pretty disruptive step - teh quivalent of shutting down an automotive assembly line. Yet Jeff was adamant about supporting the system. "If you retail guys can't get it right, you deserve to be punished," he declared. 

The story of the Andon Cord underscores yet again the obsession with the customer that permeates Amazon. But it also illustrates the importance - and the challenge - of thinking abaout *internal* customers. When I was tasked with launching the third-party marketplace, I found it very difficult to get our internal people to think about the third-party sellers with the same amount of passion as shown for shoppers. But for my group, these third-party sellers were customers who deserved to be treated with the same reverence as our website shoppers. The Andon Cord is one way to force people to pay attention to the needs of their internal or external customers - by literally shutting down the business until those needs are met.

Amazon literally has a job titled "Senior Product Manager, Andon Cord"; the employee's role is to build cross-organizational process and systems that detect and "pull the Andod Cord" when defects occur. It's a form of real-time-instrumentation to detect errors and force teams to fix them.<sup>6</sup>
