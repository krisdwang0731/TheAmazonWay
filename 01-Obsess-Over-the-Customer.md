# 1. Obsess Over the Customer

> Leaders at Amazon start with the customer and work backwards, seeking continually to earn and keep teh customer's trust. Although leaders pay attention to their competitors, they obsess over their customers.

Jeff Bezoz's customer obsession is really something beyongd a mere obsession - it's a psychosis that has generated many of his most vitriolic tirades or, many often, sarcastic comments directed at Amazon associates who have fallen short of his own standard for customer service.  It steams from Jeff's unique ability to put himself in the customer's position, deduce his or her unspoken needs and wants, and then develop a system that will meet those needs and wants better than anyone else has ever done.

杰夫·贝佐斯 (Jeff Bezoz) 对客户的痴迷真的不仅仅是一种痴迷——这种偏执导致了他的许多最尖刻的长篇大论，或者经常是针对未达到他自己的客户服务标准的亚马逊员工的讽刺评论。 它源于杰夫的独特能力，他将自己置于客户的位置，推断出他或她未说出口的需求和愿望，然后开发出一个比任何人都做得更好的系统来满足这些需求和愿望。

This approach to business is at the core of Jeff's genius. Long before social media revolutionized the retail world with its vast, transparent networks linking companies, customers, prospects, and detractors; long before companies like Zappos.com made customer service the fundation of their business model; and even long before Jeff had fully realized his own vison for Amazon.com, he had profoundly internalized two truths about customer service:

* When a company makes a customer unhappy, that customer won't tell a friend or two or three... he or she will tell many, many more; and 
* The best customer service is *no* customer service - because the best experience happens when the customer never has to asky for help at all.

Of caurse, an actual business model that doesn't require *any* customer service is about as realistic as a perpetual motion machine. But very early in the Internet revolution, Jeff saw that the online-retail model raised the bar of that was possible. He long recognized that the biggest threat to the customer experience was human beings getting involved and mucking things up. The logical corollary was that the key to creating the most pleasant, frictionless customer experience possible was minimizing human involvement through process innovation and technology.

(Of course, Amazon still needs human beings. Throughout this book, I will discuss the techniques Jeff developed to help him hire, evaluate, and retain the very best talent in the world. But Amazon's goal has always been to minimize the time and energy its talented people must spend on routine service interactions, freeing them to innovate new ways to delight the customer.)

Jeff's insight let to some counterintuitive tactics. Back in the late 1990s, Amazon.com made it intentionally difficult for customers to find the customer service number, which confused some observers who
