# Take Ownership of Results

> Leaders at Amazon are owners. They think long-term, and they don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They never say, "That's not my job." They act on behalf of the entire company, not just their own team.

Whenever I discuss the principle of ownership, I think about a famous story in Amazon company lore about a Christmas party early in the life of Amazon, which as held at a rented facility in downtown Seattle. When the employees responsible for setup realized they didn't have a stand for Christmas tree, someone decided to nail its trunk  directly to the wooden floor. "What the hell?" they thought. "We're just renting the place."

Jeff, always on the lookout for symbolic gestures to drive home his principles, pounced on the incident. For years, he used this unfortunate solution to highlight the shotcomings of the renter's mentality. "Owners would never nail a tree into the floor."

One of the biggest mistakes you can make as a leader at Amazon.com is sacrificing long-term value for short-term results. Jeff wants his people to approach every business situation as an owner, not a runner.

Of course, Amazon.com enjoys the luxury of a CEO who can think about investment with a horizon that spans years, even decades. Why? Because he still owns more than 87 million shares of the company he founded - approximately 20 percent.<sup>1</sup> Most public companies must respond to the quarterly demands for steady growth is sales, profits, and stock value from the board, the shareholders, and Wall Street. Amazon.com is able to place long bets and nurture them to maturity without as much focus on short-term results. When you look at business opportunities through a lens that's in multiple years or longer, suddenly buying the *Washingto Post* may not seem like such a crazy idea. And from the get-go, Jeff has sold investors on this idea of the long-term. That's partially why Amazon gets very different - and much higher - stock valuations than other companies. It's also why investing in scale is so vital to Amazon.com

Amazon isn't the only company to discover this secret. If you're looking for reliable indicators of enterprise value, take a look at the tenure of the leadership team. Successful organizations with long-term strategic visions tend to have a very low turn over rate at the top. The key, of course, is balancing a culture of long-term commitments with the need to deliver short-term excellence. You want a patient CEO, but you don't want an extremely patient workforce. Maintaining an atmosphere of urgency (see chapter 8, "Bias for Action") is crucial. The best way to achieve that balance is with a sense of shared ownership. Amazon.com's culture rewards people who plead passionately for their projects or ideas and are empowered to respectfully challenge decisions. In other words, people who give a damn about what they're working on - and own results.

How does Jeff build and maintain this sense of ownership among his team members? One way is by hiring the right people. The company has built an effective and scalable system for recruiting, managing, and developing high-performance talent (see chapter 5, "Hire and Develop the Best").

Another way is by instilling a sense of accoutability throughout every stratum of the organization. As co-owners of Amazon.com, every employee must be unflinching in his or her accoutability and honesty. The highest level of customer service is impossible to achieve without a high degree of accountability and a willingless to be direct, open and honest - especially when things are *not* going well.

During my time at Amazon.com, we had a philosophy called "the open kimono." If you weren't willing to be completely honest about where you, your project, or your numbers stood, then there was simply no change of attaining your goals. You had to open your kimono and willingly expose the faults, errors, and limitations of your situation. And as I learned in that 2003 S-Team meeting, if you started caveating or waffling about why you were not hitting objectives, Jeff wouldn't hesitate to tear that kimono off for you. I distinctly remember him asking one poor soul who's been rambling and tergiversating in an effort to explain away some mistake, "Which do you think you are exhibiting - gross stupidity or sheer incompetence?"

When asking for a report on a filed project, all Jeff ever wanted to know was the following: "Here's what didn't work, why it didn't work, and how we're going to change." If a project looked as if it might be heading for disaster, all he wanted to hear was, "We don't think it's going to work; let's try something else." While an honest mea culpa didn't guarantee that Jeff wouldn't pounce, at least it allowed you to retain a certain measure of self-respect... and your job. This balance of driving for success and accoutability, while realizing that some ideas are not going to work, lets the organization "fail forward." Sometimes execution is poor, and that is a performance issue. Sometimes the idea is just not quite the right idea, an so you learn, adjust, and move forward.

In *The everything Store*, Brad Stone examines this culture of unyielding accoutability and summarizeds how Bezoz's incredibly high standards frequently owewhelmed his people: "Many just couldn't take working for Bezoz any longer. he demanded more than they could possibly deliver and was extremely stingy with praise. At the same time, many...would later marvel at how much they accomplished."<sup>2</sup> Accountability is not painless. But it's the only sure path to achievement.



## Amazon's Principles of Ownership

Simply declaring that everyone in the company is an owner and that he or she will be held accountable for decisions and actions is not enough, of course. There are a number of crucial connecting principles that help transform ownership from a vague aspiration into a daily reality.

*Yes, It is your Job.* Amazon.com employees quickly learn that the phrase "That's not my job" is an express ticket to an exit interview. Ownership means not only mastering your domain but also being willing to go beyond the boundaries of your role whenever it's needed to improve customer experience or fix a problem.

Such boundary-less behavior requires an understanding of details and metrics that goes two to three degrees deeper than normal. It was uncommon for senior people at Amazon to be able to talk with knowledge and authority about details of a project that was not in their own department, let alone under their direction. It also implies a readiness to speark up and contribute without having to be asked. For example, if you have something valuable to offer in regard to a specific program, you don't wait to be invited to the next meeting about that program - you simply show up.

***You Own Your Dependencies.*** Of course, everyone in business depends on others for success. Those around you - colleagues, team members, outside suppliers and partners; those in other departments that touch your work - contribute essential elements that make you effective. This means that when they let you down, they can also cause you to fail, sometimes miserably.

At Amazon, one of your primary directives is to identify and tenaciously manage every potential business-derailing dependency you have. It is not okay to fail because of a breakdown of dependencies. That's a failure of leadership and, as you've seen, there is not much wiggle room for excuses at Amazon. When called to account for a problem caused in part or in whole by a dependency breakdown, you must be able to say, "I did these things to manage my dependencies. I went above and beyond the reasonable in my efforts to manage them." That means having rock-solid contracts, service level agreements , and penalties in place, as well as continual, active management of communications. You can assusme nothing.

In that 2003 S-Team meeting, Jeff broke down the process of managing dependencies in three easy steps (while, of course, yelling and wildly gesticulating like a madman):

1. Whenever possible, take over the dependencies so you don't have to rely on someone else.
2. If that is impossible, negotiate and manage unambiguous and clear commitments from others.
3. Create hedges whenever possible. For every dependency, devise a fallback plan - a redundancy in a supply chain, for example.

Taking absolute responsibility for every possible dependency under your purview is no small task. This is one reason that very few have the rigor, determination, and tenacity to make it in a leadership role at Amazon.com. It is a company of control freaks run by control freaks and lorded over by the king of control freaks. As one ex-engineer famously said, Jeff Bezoz is such a control freak, he "makes ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies."<sup>3</sup>

And since your own team is one of the most important dependencies under your authority, your ability to mentor those around you is a key metric during your annual evaluation. That means your success is intrinsically linked to the success your people have acquired over the course of their careers at Amazon.com.

***Compensation Rewards Long-Term Thinking.*** Finally, Amazon incentivezes ownership by designing compensation plans that reward it.

It's well know that, compared to many Silicon Vally companies that offer lavish salaries and outlandish perks, Amazon likes to run lean. The company doesn't pay for its employees' cell phones, keeps salaries low, and even uses old dors as desks. (Frugality, as I will discuss in chapter 8, has long been a forcing function for resourcefulness, self-sufficient, and invention at Amazon.com.) But that doesn't mean employees aren't well compensated. Amazon just prefers to reward employees with stock options rather than salary or cash bonuses.

Jeff explained this logic in the 1997 shareholder letter: "We know your success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner."<sup>4</sup> Jeff incentivized us by letting us share in the rewards of company growth. In so doing, he got us constantly thinking about the long term.

The beauty of the ownership principle is that once you've established it in your organization, it works as a flywheel to drive leadership principle number three: Invent and Simplify.
