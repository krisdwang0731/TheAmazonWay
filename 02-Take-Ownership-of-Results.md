# Take Ownership of Results

> Leaders at Amazon are owners. They think long-term, and they don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They never say, "That's not my job." They act on behalf of the entire company, not just their own team.

Whenever I discuss the principle of ownership, I think about a famous story in Amazon company lore about a Christmas party early in the life of Amazon, which as held at a rented facility in downtown Seattle. When the employees responsible for setup realized they didn't have a stand for Christmas tree, someone decided to nail its trunk  directly to the wooden floor. "What the hell?" they thought. "We're just renting the place."

Jeff, always on the lookout for symbolic gestures to drive home his principles, pounced on the incident. For years, he used this unfortunate solution to highlight the shotcomings of the renter's mentality. "Owners would never nail a tree into the floor."

One of the biggest mistakes you can make as a leader at Amazon.com is sacrificing long-term value for short-term results. Jeff wants his people to approach every business situation as an owner, not a runner.

Of course, Amazon.com enjoys the luxury of a CEO who can think about investment with a horizon that spans years, even decades. Why? Because he still owns more than 87 million shares of the company he founded - approximately 20 percent.<sup>1</sup> Most public companies must respond to the quarterly demands for steady growth is sales, profits, and stock value from the board, the shareholders, and Wall Street. Amazon.com is able to place long bets and nurture them to maturity without as much focus on short-term results. When you look at business opportunities through a lens that's in multiple years or longer, suddenly buying the *Washingto Post* may not seem like such a crazy idea. And from the get-go, Jeff has sold investors on this idea of the long-term. That's partially why Amazon gets very different - and much higher - stock valuations than other companies. It's also why investing in scale is so vital to Amazon.com

Amazon isn't the only company to discover this secret. If you're looking for reliable indicators of enterprise value, take a look at the tenure of the leadership team. Successful organizations with long-term strategic visions tend to have a very low turn over rate at the top. The key, of course, is balancing a culture of long-term commitments with the need to deliver short-term excellence. You want a patient CEO, but you don't want an extremely patient workforce. Maintaining an atmosphere of urgency (see chapter 8, "Bias for Action") is crucial. The best way to achieve that balance is with a sense of shared ownership. Amazon.com's culture rewards people who plead passionately for their projects or ideas and are empowered to respectfully challenge decisions. In other words, people who give a damn about what they're working on - and own results.
