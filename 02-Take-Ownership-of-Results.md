# Take Ownership of Results

> Leaders at Amazon are owners. They think long-term, and they don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They never say, "That's not my job." They act on behalf of the entire company, not just their own team.

Whenever I discuss the principle of ownership, I think about a famous story in Amazon company lore about a Christmas party early in the life of Amazon, which as held at a rented facility in downtown Seattle. When the employees responsible for setup realized they didn't have a stand for Christmas tree, someone decided to nail its trunk  directly to the wooden floor. "What the hell?" they thought. "We're just renting the place."
