## Lessons Learned Along "The Amazon Way"

My goal is writing *The Amazon Way* was to offer insights and actionable techniques to increase company speed, improve accoutability, create clarity, and innovate customer experiences.

Sine publishing the book in June 2014, I've collaborated with hundreds of teams and leaders, applying lessons from the book to their cultures and business. What I didn't expect was the feedback, the energy - and, quite frankly, the frustration that accompanied the process of creating change.

The press wanted to know the same thing the business leaders did: What is Amazon's "secret sause"? *The Amazon Way* was favorably reviewed, perhaps most notably by *The New York Times* ("*Examining The Amazon Way*"), and I spent two days being interviewed by David Faber of CNBC for the documentary *Amazon Rising*.

Years later, the invitations to speak to leaders and their teams continue. Organizations want to innovate, move faster, operate better, break down bureaucracy, build new business models, and incorporate digital capabilities in everything they do - and they continue to look to Amazon as a model.

Why? Because Jeff Bezos's company not only continues to grow, it still innovate, experiments, make big bets, pioneers new business models, demonstrates the advantages of scale, and, yes, even reports profitability.

In other words, Amazon does not rest on it laurels - nor does it stop questioning its own orientation. It remains willing to learn from its mistakes and even adjusts its doctrines when necessary.

Case in point: the very guiding precepts my book examined. Amazon recently replaced the leadership principle "Be Vocally Self-Critical" with "Learn and Be Curious". This revision is an helpful principles to become outdated or brittle dogma.

Consequently, I figured it's time to update *The Amazon Way* to not only include this new leadership principle and examine the company's accompanying shift in doctrine but to also highlight what I've been hearing from leaders in all sorts of organizations and at every level as the explore the Amazon Way.



## Create obsession about customers and about the right results.

A single word can make a huge difference. Consider "obsession" versus "satisfaction". Typical management strives to create and measure "consumer satisfaction." They work to create slightly more satisfied customer than the competitor and measure the experience in various ways. What if, instead, you "obsessed" over your customer? What would you need to do to delight your customers(this includs internal customers) but do so with the same or improved cost and efficiency? You would likely have to change many things about business.

In so many industries, lots of companies are attempting great disruptions. At the center of successful disruption invairably lies great customer experience (For exmaple, Uber.) When a disruption stalls, it's often because the customer experience is not at the center of the solution. Take the payments industry. Retailers want to avoid the interchange fee. Platforms like Apple Pay and Google Wallet are offering solutions, but the current offerings don't really solve a fundamental user problem. For exmaple, I still can't get a history of payments and easily manage them from my mobile payments.



## Simplify, integrate, and automate processes to scale your business.

To delight your customers, make your service cheaper, faster, and of higher quality. Leaders at Amazon learn how to automate their processes and work to continually reduce manual steps, interventions, and labor costs. Making your customer interactions self-service is the key strategy to an accomplish this goal (read Appendix: Future-Ready Selft-Service)



## Enable accountability and manage depenencies.

In *The Amazon Way*, I talk about the concept of "managing dependencies." Part of a great lecture I heard at Amazon was, "It is not okey to fail because of a breakdown of dependencies. That's a failure of leadership." You are always dependent upon others in business - other teams, partners, vendors, products, services. The mentality of "managing your dependencies" is key to being a leader at Amazon. As I've been talking with leaders, this concept of "managing depencies" in an aggressive manner and far beyond a normal expectation really resonates. I am often asked how it's accomplished. While there are many ways, start by asking a lot more and deeper questions than you nomally do with your colleagues. Secondly, don't just trust. Instead, trust and verify. When this becomes the norm in a company, then asking for details is no longer seen as a challenge to someone's competency. Finally, create and manage service level commitments on all capacities - and hold your partners accoutable.

 

## Drive continous improvement through instrumentation.

One of the many benefits of automating processes is that real-time data and business intelligence can be captured and used. A very specific term is used for this at Amazon - instrumentation. Teams are typically able dramatically increase the collection and use of real-time data in processes and use the data to give insights to reduce errors, improve cycly time, and decrease costs by applying automation and seeking instrumentation.



## Develop platform strategies.

Amazon is the market leader it cloud computing. Cloud computing frees companies from buying computers and hiring administration staff to manage them. Instead, it allows them to rent and scale up or down on a dynamic basis. Amazon entered this business because they recognized that they possessed a core competency on computer infrastructure and that others might benefit from it. The benefit from Amazon is scale. They have also done this on many other functions. Fulfillment by Amazon - FBA - is an "on-demand" use of Amazon's fulfillment network and lets other business avoid the capital cost and operating complexity of warehouse nad transportation networks. Leaders should evaluate and ask tow critical questions. First, what functions do we operate today that should convert to "as-a-service" capability and leverage others' capabilities? Second, do we have core competencies that we could let others leverage to create a new business opportunity?



## Create small, independent teams to avoid bureaucracy.

Bureaucracy is a killer to innovation, and high-performing employees are not atrracted to companies or divisions in which they cannot make a differences. Small teams are one of the keys to avoiding complexity and attracting greate talent at Amazon. The key to the small teams (six to ten people or smaller) is that they truly own something - a product or feature; a service like the checkout cart; or a process like the warehouse receive process. Each team defines its business plan, metrics, and product roadmap. This drives motivation and continuous improvement, while providing tranparency and accountability for future investment and results. Evaluate your business and organization structure, and identify opportunity to create small, autonomous teams that are truly empowered to make a difference.



## It is all about technology, but not about your IT department.

Here's the biggest surprise about Amazon - the centralized information technology group is relatively small, but the technology capability of Amazon is huge. Technology planning, architecting, and development are dispersed accross most teams at Amazon. There is very small centralized technology function. Compare that with most companies are set up with large centralized technology functions and business leaders who are not expected to understand, design or implement technology. The future will be won by companies that raise the technology capability of all business leaders and build technology capability closer to the customer with itegrated technology and business teams.



## Develop clarity and simplicity in what you are doing and not doing.

Michael Porter, Harvard professor of strategy, states that strategy can be define as making trade-offs in competing and choosing what not to do. The fundamental mistake leaders make in developing digital strategies is not seeking calarity regarding the customer experience. What will delight the customer and force changes to those business practices that don't add value to the customer but incredible complexity on teams creating new technology? At Amazon, leaders write narratives of plans. They start with the end in mind via a future press relase or deliberately assess how to measure long-term success of a capability or team. Begin with a clear, simple roadmap to the destination.



## Experiment more through small bets.

Executives talk about "failing forward" and mistake bets. Most do not understand the essence of innovating or operate in an environment that gives permission or patience for this. What happens? Safe investments are proposed, really big monolithic projects get funded, and incremental changes occur. In the 2015 shareholder letter, Bezoz called Amazon "the greatest company to fail at." Amazon is doubling its number of experiments and has a clear portfolio mentality between "scaling investments" that have a clear ROI versus "bets" that often fail. The strategy is to lay lots of bets at an affordable price.



## Raise your "Change IQ"

The best part about working at Amazon is that everything is always on an improvement path. There is nothing static. Make is faster, add new features, do it cheaper, reduce errors, delight the customer - constant change. Operating well is now a necessary to compete. Every company has to be able to create continuous change and embrace continuous improvement. This is the Change IQ. Warren Buffet tells boards and CEOs to combat the "ABCs" (aoorgance, bureaucracy, and complacency) into which successful businesses and team fail. To avoid the ABCs, set the expectation and forcing functions to create a culture with a high Change IQ.
