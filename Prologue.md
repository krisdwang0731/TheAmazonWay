## Lessons Learned Along "The Amazon Way"

## 《亚马逊之道》的经验教训

My goal is writing *The Amazon Way* was to offer insights and actionable techniques to increase company speed, improve accountability, create clarity, and innovate customer experiences.

我写《亚马逊之道》这本书的目的是为了提供洞察力和可行的技巧，从而提升公司速度，改进责任心，提高透明度以及创新客户体验。

Sine publishing the book in June 2014, I've collaborated with hundreds of teams and leaders, applying lessons from the book to their cultures and business. What I didn't expect was the feedback, the energy - and, quite frankly, the frustration that accompanied the process of creating change.

自从 2014 年 6 月出版这本书以来，我与数百个团队和领导者合作，将书中的经验应用于他们的文化和业务。坦率地讲，让我没有想到的是，在改变的过程中，活力和沮丧交织在了一起。

The press wanted to know the same thing the business leaders did: What is Amazon's "secret sause"? *The Amazon Way* was favorably reviewed, perhaps most notably by *The New York Times* ("*Examining The Amazon Way*"), and I spent two days being interviewed by David Faber of CNBC for the documentary *Amazon Rising*.

面对商业领袖，媒体都想知道一个同样的问题：“亚马逊的秘诀是什么”？《亚马逊之道》获得好评，或许最引人注目的是《纽约时报》（《审视亚马逊之道》），以及我花了两天时间接受了CNBC记者David Faber的采访，以拍摄纪录片《亚马逊崛起》。

Years later, the invitations to speak to leaders and their teams continue. Organizations want to innovate, move faster, operate better, break down bureaucracy, build new business models, and incorporate digital capabilities in everything they do - and they continue to look to Amazon as a model.

多年后，与领导人及其团队的谈话邀请仍在继续。组织想要创新、更快地行动、更好地运营、打破官僚主义、建立新的商业模式，并将数字能力融入他们所做的一切——他们继续将亚马逊视为一种典范。

Why? Because Jeff Bezos's company not only continues to grow, it still innovate, experiments, make big bets, pioneers new business models, demonstrates the advantages of scale, and, yes, even reports profitability.

为什么？ 因为杰夫·贝佐斯的公司不仅在继续发展，而且依然在创新、试验、下大赌注、开拓新的商业模式、展示规模优势，是的，甚至还报告了盈利能力。

In other words, Amazon does not rest on it laurels - nor does it stop questioning its own orientation. It remains willing to learn from its mistakes and even adjusts its doctrines when necessary.

换句话说，亚马逊并没有固步自封——也没有停止质疑自己的定位。 它仍然愿意从错误中吸取教训，甚至在必要时调整其信条。

Case in point: the very guiding precepts my book examined. Amazon recently replaced the leadership principle "Be Vocally Self-Critical" with "Learn and Be Curious". This revision is an helpful principles to become outdated or brittle dogma.

Consequently, I figured it's time to update *The Amazon Way* to not only include this new leadership principle and examine the company's accompanying shift in doctrine but to also highlight what I've been hearing from leaders in all sorts of organizations and at every level as the explore the Amazon Way.

因此，我认为是时候更新 《亚马逊之道》 这不仅包括新的领导力原则并审视公司随之而来的原则转变，而且还要突出我从各种组织和各个级别的领导者那里听到的对亚马逊之道的探索。



## Create obsession about customers and about the right results.



A single word can make a huge difference. Consider "obsession" versus "satisfaction". Typical management strives to create and measure "consumer satisfaction." They work to create slightly more satisfied customer than the competitor and measure the experience in various ways. What if, instead, you "obsessed" over your customer? What would you need to do to delight your customers(this includs internal customers) but do so with the same or improved cost and efficiency? You would likely have to change many things about business.

In so many industries, lots of companies are attempting great disruptions. At the center of successful disruption invairably lies great customer experience (For exmaple, Uber.) When a disruption stalls, it's often because the customer experience is not at the center of the solution. Take the payments industry. Retailers want to avoid the interchange fee. Platforms like Apple Pay and Google Wallet are offering solutions, but the current offerings don't really solve a fundamental user problem. For exmaple, I still can't get a history of payments and easily manage them from my mobile payments.



## Simplify, integrate, and automate processes to scale your business.

To delight your customers, make your service cheaper, faster, and of higher quality. Leaders at Amazon learn how to automate their processes and work to continually reduce manual steps, interventions, and labor costs. Making your customer interactions self-service is the key strategy to an accomplish this goal (read Appendix: Future-Ready Selft-Service)



## Enable accountability and manage depenencies.

In *The Amazon Way*, I talk about the concept of "managing dependencies." Part of a great lecture I heard at Amazon was, "It is not okey to fail because of a breakdown of dependencies. That's a failure of leadership." You are always dependent upon others in business - other teams, partners, vendors, products, services. The mentality of "managing your dependencies" is key to being a leader at Amazon. As I've been talking with leaders, this concept of "managing depencies" in an aggressive manner and far beyond a normal expectation really resonates. I am often asked how it's accomplished. While there are many ways, start by asking a lot more and deeper questions than you nomally do with your colleagues. Secondly, don't just trust. Instead, trust and verify. When this becomes the norm in a company, then asking for details is no longer seen as a challenge to someone's competency. Finally, create and manage service level commitments on all capacities - and hold your partners accoutable.

 

## Drive continous improvement through instrumentation.

One of the many benefits of automating processes is that real-time data and business intelligence can be captured and used. A very specific term is used for this at Amazon - instrumentation. Teams are typically able dramatically increase the collection and use of real-time data in processes and use the data to give insights to reduce errors, improve cycly time, and decrease costs by applying automation and seeking instrumentation.



## Develop platform strategies.

Amazon is the market leader it cloud computing. Cloud computing frees companies from buying computers and hiring administration staff to manage them. Instead, it allows them to rent and scale up or down on a dynamic basis. Amazon entered this business because they recognized that they possessed a core competency on computer infrastructure and that others might benefit from it. The benefit from Amazon is scale. They have also done this on many other functions. Fulfillment by Amazon - FBA - is an "on-demand" use of Amazon's fulfillment network and lets other business avoid the capital cost and operating complexity of warehouse nad transportation networks. Leaders should evaluate and ask tow critical questions. First, what functions do we operate today that should convert to "as-a-service" capability and leverage others' capabilities? Second, do we have core competencies that we could let others leverage to create a new business opportunity?



## Create small, independent teams to avoid bureaucracy.

Bureaucracy is a killer to innovation, and high-performing employees are not atrracted to companies or divisions in which they cannot make a differences. Small teams are one of the keys to avoiding complexity and attracting greate talent at Amazon. The key to the small teams (six to ten people or smaller) is that they truly own something - a product or feature; a service like the checkout cart; or a process like the warehouse receive process. Each team defines its business plan, metrics, and product roadmap. This drives motivation and continuous improvement, while providing tranparency and accountability for future investment and results. Evaluate your business and organization structure, and identify opportunity to create small, autonomous teams that are truly empowered to make a difference.



## It is all about technology, but not about your IT department.

Here's the biggest surprise about Amazon - the centralized information technology group is relatively small, but the technology capability of Amazon is huge. Technology planning, architecting, and development are dispersed accross most teams at Amazon. There is very small centralized technology function. Compare that with most companies are set up with large centralized technology functions and business leaders who are not expected to understand, design or implement technology. The future will be won by companies that raise the technology capability of all business leaders and build technology capability closer to the customer with itegrated technology and business teams.



## Develop clarity and simplicity in what you are doing and not doing.

Michael Porter, Harvard professor of strategy, states that strategy can be define as making trade-offs in competing and choosing what not to do. The fundamental mistake leaders make in developing digital strategies is not seeking calarity regarding the customer experience. What will delight the customer and force changes to those business practices that don't add value to the customer but incredible complexity on teams creating new technology? At Amazon, leaders write narratives of plans. They start with the end in mind via a future press relase or deliberately assess how to measure long-term success of a capability or team. Begin with a clear, simple roadmap to the destination.



## Experiment more through small bets.

Executives talk about "failing forward" and mistake bets. Most do not understand the essence of innovating or operate in an environment that gives permission or patience for this. What happens? Safe investments are proposed, really big monolithic projects get funded, and incremental changes occur. In the 2015 shareholder letter, Bezoz called Amazon "the greatest company to fail at." Amazon is doubling its number of experiments and has a clear portfolio mentality between "scaling investments" that have a clear ROI versus "bets" that often fail. The strategy is to lay lots of bets at an affordable price.



## Raise your "Change IQ"

The best part about working at Amazon is that everything is always on an improvement path. There is nothing static. Make is faster, add new features, do it cheaper, reduce errors, delight the customer - constant change. Operating well is now a necessary to compete. Every company has to be able to create continuous change and embrace continuous improvement. This is the Change IQ. Warren Buffet tells boards and CEOs to combat the "ABCs" (aoorgance, bureaucracy, and complacency) into which successful businesses and team fail. To avoid the ABCs, set the expectation and forcing functions to create a culture with a high Change IQ.

Why does Amazon create this perpetual environment of innovation and continuous improvement? They firmly believe that if you are not creating and managing digital disruption, you will be a victim of it. The speed of evolution in business is accelerating. The life span of companies on the S&P 500 Index is a great indication of this acceleration. Three out of four companies on the S&P Index are predicted to fall out it in the next fifteen years. It is truly "innovate or dir." Ask yourself, "How would our business and industry change if Amazon operate it?" You might come up with some surprising ideas.

In dicussing why Amazon is always pushing to invent, Jeff Bezoz told TV commentator, Charlie Rose in a 2013 interview that "companies have short lift spans and Amazon will be disrupted one day. I don't worry about it because I know it is inevitable. Companies come and go. Companies that are the shiniest and most important of any era, and you just with a couple of decades and they are gone. I would love for it [Amazon's disruption] to be after I'm died." Companies that don't let the past models and successes define who they are will be the ones that span and define the next ones.

These are just a few of the conversations and represent some of the feedback I have received from readers working to adjust their company cultures. I hope *The Amazon Way* gives you some ideas you can start using today.
