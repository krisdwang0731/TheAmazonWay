## Lessons Learned Along "The Amazon Way"

My goal is writing *The Amazon Way* was to offer insights and actionable techniques to increase company speed, improve accoutability, create clarity, and innovate customer experiences.

Sine publishing the book in June 2014, I've collaborated with hundreds of teams and leaders, applying lessons from the book to their cultures and business. What I didn't expect was the feedback, the energy - and, quite frankly, the frustration that accompanied the process of creating change.

The press wanted to know the same thing the business leaders did: What is Amazon's "secret sause"? *The Amazon Way* was favorably reviewed, perhaps most notably by *The New York Times* ("*Examining The Amazon Way*"), and I spent two days being interviewed by David Faber of CNBC for the documentary *Amazon Rising*.

Years later, the invitations to speak to leaders and their teams continue. Organizations want to innovate, move faster, operate better, break down bureaucracy, build new business models, and incorporate digital capabilities in everything they do - and they continue to look to Amazon as a model.

Why? Because Jeff Bezos's company not only continues to grow, it still innovate, experiments, make big bets, pioneers new business models, demonstrates the advantages of scale, and, yes, even reports profitability.

In other words, Amazon does not rest on it laurels - nor does it stop questioning its own orientation. It remains willing to learn from its mistakes and even adjusts its doctrines when necessary.

Case in point: the very guiding precepts my book examined. Amazon recently replaced the leadership principle "Be Vocally Self-Critical" with "Learn and Be Curious". This revision is an helpful principles to become outdated or brittle dogma.

Consequently, I figured it's time to update *The Amazon Way* to not only include this new leadership principle and examine the company's accompanying shift in doctrine but to also highlight what I've been hearing from leaders in all sorts of organizations and at every level as the explore the Amazon Way.



## Create obsession about customers and about the right results.

A single word can make a huge difference. Consider "obsession" versus "satisfaction". Typical management strives to create and measure "consumer satisfaction." They work to create slightly more satisfied customer than the competitor and measure the experience in various ways. What if, instead, you "obsessed" over your customer? What would you need to do to delight your customers(this includs internal customers) but do so with the same or improved cost and efficiency? You would likely have to change many things about business.

In so many industries, lots of companies are attempting great disruptions. At the center of successful disruption invairably lies great customer experience (For exmaple, Uber.) When a disruption stalls, it's often because the customer experience is not at the center of the solution. Take the payments industry. Retailers want to avoid the interchange fee. Platforms like Apple Pay and Google Wallet are offering solutions, but the current offerings don't really solve a fundamental user problem. For exmaple, I still can't get a history of payments and easily manage them from my mobile payments.
